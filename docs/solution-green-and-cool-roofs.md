## Overview

* **Green and Cool Roofs:** Low-impact solutions for urban heat island mitigation and energy reduction.
* **Promotion:** Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, EPA's ENERGY STAR program.
* **Breakthroughs:** Ecosystem-mimicking roofs, living walls, solar-integrated green roofs, reflective cool roofs.
* **Impact:** Greenhouse gas emission reduction through enhanced building energy efficiency.

## Progress Made

* **Types:** Green roofs for insulation; cool roofs for sunlight reflection.
* **Technologies:** Modular (pre-vegetated) and living green roofs.
* **Urban Heat Island Mitigation:** Up to 20-40% reduction in cooling energy.
* **Stormwater Runoff:** Reduced runoff, alleviating sewer system strain and flood risks.
* **Key Players:** Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, Green Roof Infrastructure Services, Living Roof Company.

## Lessons Learned

* **Air Quality:** Improved by trapping particulate matter and providing green spaces.
* **Challenges:** Building code requirements, costs, and maintenance.
