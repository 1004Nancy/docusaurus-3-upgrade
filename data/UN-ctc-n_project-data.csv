Context
Colombia's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development is in charge together with several stakeholders at the national level, to guide the country in adapting to climate change through mainstreaming it into territorial, sectoral and land planning. Finding concrete solutions and measures to implement at the local level will help reducing the vulnerahility of the country and population in addition to a sustainable development of the country. Some territories and sectors are currently developing vulnerability and impact assessments; however the country has found a constraint in homogenizing a methodology that can keep track of several implemented results of Plans and Projects in adaptation to climate change. Following the implementation of nearly 25 adaptation plans and projects in coastal and continental regions, coordinating entities of the National Adaptation Plan of Colombia identified the lack of a robust indicator system for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of adaptation actions as one of the main barriers to an integrated adaptation. Therefore, there is a need for assistance in the development of an evaluation and monitoring system that strengthen decision-maker processes about Climate Change strategies and plans at national level, as the evidence on the impact of such interventions appears limited. This system should include a portfolio of indicators that allow evaluating and monitoring of adaptation actions and identify vulnerable regions and monitoring changes in specific regions/cities of the country.
Technology Request
Colombia's Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development requested support to develop an evaluation and monitoring system including indicators that can be utilized to assess and improve the country's efforts in adapting to climate change. The effort was lead by lead by the Directorate of Climate Change of the Ministry of   Environment   and   Sustainable   Development   (MADS-DCC), in close coordination with the National Department of  Planning  (NPD),  the  Colombian  Institute  for  Hydrology, Meteorology  and  Environmental  Studies  (IDEAM)  and  the National Disaster Risk Management Unit (UNGR).

Nationally Determined Contribution to give ""Priority to develop a smart and resilient agriculture, including through the use of renewable energies"".
Context
In Mali, climate variability threatens agricultural productivity and farmer livelihoods. Current methods of crop conservation lead to significant waste in the value chain, and weaken farmers' access to markets, reducing their revenues. Local entrepreneurs seek to install solar photovoltaic-powered processing and storage technologies to improve productivity and resilience, yet lack financial means to do so. The Action Group for Modernisation of Agriculture (GAMA), in Southern Mali aims to improve farming stability in the face of increasing vulnerability of crop production due to climate change. A key piece of their strategy is to use renewable energy source for drying, processing and storage technologies for mangoes, potatoes and gombo. Used at sufficient scale, these technologies increase shelf life and availability of the product to the market, thereby increasing resilience to change and food security. The project has considerable potential to attract private sector financing, but the upfront investment constitutes the main obstacle, and investors are not convinced of its bankability.

Nationally Determined Contribution to ""enhance the established enabling legal, policy and institutional environment for a low carbon emission development pathway to achieve poverty reduction and sustainable development"".
Context
In Côte d'Ivoire, climate change is becoming more apparent at all levels and in all sectors, as various anthropogenic pressures and the risk of natural disasters are increasingly recurring. In search for effective solutions to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, up-to date data on the state of the environment  and  national  development  are  key  to  monitor changes  in  critical  parameters and enable knowledge-based decision making. However, Côte d’Ivoire  has  faced  a  lack  of environmental  and natural resource data. This lack of sufficient, timely and adequate information frequently resulted in delayed or uninformed decision-making that negatively impacted  environmental,  societal, and economic sectors. The development of an environmental information system (EIS) can provide a means to access important information on the environment and climate change for decision making. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Côte d’Ivoire took the initiative to develop a Disaster Risk Reduction  (DRR) platform  that  aims  to  prevent  and/or  cope with  the  potential  threats  of  climate  variations. In order to function, this platform required data to be available through an environment management system. 
Technology Request
The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of Côte d'Ivoire requested support in developing an environmental information system (EIS) to coordinate important data and enable sound planning and decision-making.

Context
Many of the sandy beaches along the Mauritius coastline are eroding and the erosion will be aggravated due to the impact of Climate Change. The beaches are of great importance for Mauritius, partly as an integrated part of the marine, coral and lagoon environment and partly as an important landscape resource of great importance for the tourism industry. Consequently, it is of great importance to identify sustainable ways of protecting the beaches against historical and future erosion. 
The result of the site visit to the potential offshore sand mining areas, as part of the CTCN technical assistance, showed that it was not feasible to use sand from offshore sand mining areas for beach nourishment. DHI, as CTCN expert contracted, has recommended an alternative activity  to strengthen the Ministry’s of Social Security, National Solidarity, and Environment and Sustainable Development capacity to manage the existing beaches and to make plans and environmental impact assessments for utilizing land based sand resources.

Context
Costa Rica has a long tradition of leadership and innovation in sustainable development and environmental protection. As part of its efforts to address the challenges of climate change, the country recently sent its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The INDC focuses on a concept of climate action that transcends the traditional separation of adaptation and mitigation; rather, it aims to exploit possible synergies and create an integrated strategy for these two action areas.
In terms of mitigation, Costa Rica has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 9.47 million tons of CO2 by 2030 as part of a long-term decarbonisation plan aimed at achieving net carbon neutrality by 2085. In terms of adaptation, the country will develop a National Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy by 2016 and a National Adaptation Plan by 2018, alongside a series of complementary measures. These include ecosystem- and community-based adaptation, public infrastructure adaptation and capacity building. Costa Rica also intends to establish itself as a country-level testing ground for low-emissions development.
All of these plans require a robust system, with integrated monitoring and an evaluation infrastructure that includes a wide range of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) mechanisms, accompanied by an accessible information system to facilitate decision-making. Costa Rica has made substantial efforts to build capacity, resulting in a solid body of knowledge and a strong band of local experts. This knowledge is, however, scattered and highly sectoral, thereby limiting its accessibility and use.
There is therefore a need to develop a National Metrics System for Climate Change that will centralize climate change information from a variety of sources. This will be made available through an open-access data platform and integrated in a series of key performance indicators (KPIs) that will effectively and efficiently demonstrate progress in Costa Rica’s climate change efforts.
Assistance Requested
Transfer and exchange of experiences with other countries that are at a more advanced stage of developing national metrics systems for climate change.
Workshops with national and international experts to develop the system’s KPIs.
Development of a detailed system design (including data stream) based on the KPI requirements.
General consultation of stakeholders in order to validate the system’s detailed design.
Development of data exchange processes with key actors and sectors on two areas of work:
Technical protocol workflow
Trust-building workflow and capacity

Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Climate change monitoring
Monitoring and evaluation for adaptation
Open source climate data and tools
Expected Benefits
CTCN assistance is expected to result in a robust set of KPIs aimed at monitoring Costa Rica’s climate change efforts, which will enable a better system to be designed. Through this support, Costa Rica expects to improve the transparency of its information and commitment to climate change challenges, thereby resulting in better decision-making. Moreover, a solid SINAMECC would greatly facilitate the MRV efforts of future projects and programmes. This is a major factor in the drive to becoming a country-level testing ground for mitigation and adaptation technologies aimed at a low-emissions economy.

Nationally Determined Contribution to use land use planning as a tool to decrease long-term vulnerabilities of its population, enhance its food security and the resilience of its infrastructure. The NDC also includes a committment to have a land use plan in every city and coastal area by 2020,  which considers vulnerabilities to climate change and measures for increasing adaptation and mitigation
Context
Costa Rica has, for a number of years, recognized the urgent need for appropriate national land-use planning to ensure that land is used in accordance with its capacity and to guarantee the sustainable use of natural resources and urban growth. This planning must minimize the environmental impacts of human activity, reduce the risk of disasters, demonstrate resilience to climate change and provide participatory tools for informed decision-making. The issue of land-use planning in Costa Rica is of direct relevance to local governments, as they are constitutionally designated as autonomous regional bodies with responsibility for municipal/canton-level public structures, and for the administration of interests and services within that area. To fulfil this mandate, legal and technical frameworks have been in place in the country since 1968 to determine the land forms and uses present in a given geographical area.
The tool used for this purpose is known as a Land-Use Plan (Plan de Ordenamiento Territorial – POT). It aims to organize, plan and ensure the sustainable use of geographical spaces in terms of their human development, environmental protection and natural resources. In order to comply with this definition and these principles, the Government passed Executive Decree 32967 in 2006, officially setting out the methodology for incorporating environmental aspects into the regulatory plans and any other type of land-use planning. This methodology has since established a mechanism whereby the State ensures that all POTs incorporate actions aimed at minimizing the environmental impact of various human activities (urban planning, industry, agriculture, conservation, etc.) into their land-use and zoning proposals.Although this tool has resulted in elements of sustainability being included in land-use planning, from the outset there has been a gap in terms of the necessary evaluation and analysis of threats such as climate change within land-use planning. Consequently, now that climate change has been scientifically proven and its impacts are being felt locally on a daily basis, Costa Rica has no mechanism or protocol enabling it to address climate change by developing and implementing adaptation measures within land-use planning processes.
SETENA (the State body with responsibility for validating the environmental sustainability of POTs) therefore wishes to rectify this situation by updating the current protocol (i.e. E.D. 32967) to include climate change as a factor that must be evaluated by local governments during land-use planning processes in Costa Rica. The aim is to identify adaptation measures that are consistent with the country-level guidelines being proposed as part of the climate change adaptation plans and policies.
Assistance Requested
The assistance that MINAE-SETENA is requesting of the CTCN is aimed at developing the necessary technical and scientific basis that will enable climate change to be incorporated and assessed within land-use planning processes (both terrestrial and marine environments). This will involve the SETENA Department for Strategic Environmental Assessment (DEAE), which is directly responsible for assessing the environmental component of all proposed POTs in Costa Rica. Technical assistance is specifically required to:
Create the necessary technical and technological capacity within the DEAE to develop the technical basis required to guide local governments in assessing and identifying climate change adaptation measures within land-use plans.
Coordinate processes with key actors, such as the country’s public institutions and productive sectors, to support the production of a protocol that will enable local governments to implement climate change adaptation measures in POTs.
Exchange experiences with other countries where the issue of climate change adaptation is being implemented in local land-use plans.
Organize consultation and validation workshops on the intended protocol with key actors (productive sectors, academics, public institutions).

Expected Benefits
Being able to produce the necessary tools that enable climate change impacts to be included and assessed in land-use planning processes will constitute a major step forward for Costa Rica in the process of implementing effective adaptation measures. Direct impacts will include the INDCs for the next 15 years that Costa Rica will present to the world at the forthcoming COP. The protocol will, specifically, contribute to the adaptation processes that need to be jointly implemented by local governments and various sectors: energy, agriculture, health, infrastructure, biodiversity and water resources. These are all largely dependent on the spatial management and planning undertaken for these activities in the country.
In addition to the priority sectors for work on adaptation measures, Costa Rica will also now have an ally in the local governments, with whom it will implement more detailed actions than those provided for in the National Adaptation Plan. This will contribute directly to measures related to disaster risk reduction, public infrastructure adaptation, environmental health, capacity building (technology transfer) and to the increased awareness and knowledge of climate change that need to exist among the population, along with community-based adaptation processes (meeting basic needs). Finally, the implementation of ecosystem-based adaptation processes will be facilitated by the fact that the protocol assesses the impact of climate change on the biodiversity present in areas that are under the administration of local governments.

Context
Aujourd’hui, on constate une prolifération des déchets solides dans la ville de Conakry qui produite environ 1000 tonnes par jour d’après les statistiques du Ministère de l’Environnement. Cette situation a  des conséquences importantes sur la santé des populations avec le manque d’hygiène, la prolifération des maladies, la pollution de l’environnement. Le manque de traitement approprié de ces déchets conduit les populations à les brûler ou à les déposer à ciel ouvert provoquant ainsi une plus grande émission des gaz à effet serre. Actuellement, avec  l’évolution technologique, ces déchets peuvent être transformés soit en compost pour l’agriculture ou source d’énergie par la production du méthane. Il existe un problème de taille pour arriver à ces résultats, la Guinée toute entière ne dispose d’aucune installation conforme aux normes internationales permettant un traitement adéquat des déchets et d’ailleurs, la grande décharge de la ville de Conakry (la Minière) est un vrai problème pour les autorités nationales. Pourtant des expériences d’ailleurs peuvent aider à faire face à ce problème. Lors d’une visite en Belgique d’un cadre de la Direction Nationale de la Recherche, des contacts avaient été pris avec des autorités locales, des partenaires privés, un institut de Recherche pour voir dans quelles mesures une usine de traitement de déchets pourrait être implantée à Conakry. Aujourd’hui, il serait important de reprendre ces contacts, de travailler dans une logique multi acteurs à la préparation d’un dossier de projet pour rechercher expertise et financement à sa réalisation. Donc, il nous faut des ressources techniques, financières, humaines pour faire suite à ces échanges, concevoir une projet et aller à la recherche des voies et moyens à sa réalisation, notamment à la rencontre des partenaires techniques et financiers qui seraient intéressés.
Pour le CREGED, l’installation d’une unité moderne de traitement de déchets est plus que nécessaire et notamment pour la ville de Conakry.

Context
Tonga is amongst the small island states that are encountering the need to balance the national requirements of meeting the nation’s energy needs and to reduce Tonga’s GHG emissions in order to tackle climate change impacts. Such dilemma permit the government to deduce the best social, environmental and economic options to tackle these issues while ensuring a sustainable development is still achieved.
Like any small Pacific island states, Tonga depends entirely on imported fossil fuel for its energy necessity. Any increases or disruptions to the global cost of oil will intricate Tonga’s economy and development. To tackle any unprecedented issue arise from imported oil and climate change impacts, the Tongan government developed a national target in 2012, which is to achieve 50% of its electricity generation from renewable energy by 2020. To date, Tonga has invested millions of donor funds in construction of off-grid and on-grid solar PV systems. These investments contribute up to 7% of the target while addition renewable energy projects are currently under development and it is anticipated to contribute to meeting target by 2020.
The challenge that the Energy Department recently identified is that a substantial resource has been committed to increasing the renewable energy generation mix in Tonga but there are lacks of energy efficiency development. At first, it may appear that energy efficiency is a contradictory approach between the use of less energy and the need to meet the energy need of the nation. However, this is not the case anymore as Tonga realized that energy efficiency initiatives with supported policies/strategies are the cheapest and reliable initiatives for saving energy and money and reducing our GHG emissions. Hence, the Energy Department is seeking CTCN to develop a Tonga Energy Efficiency Master Plan with achievable EE and GHG mitigation targets to ensure the transition to an energy efficient future for Tonga.

Context
A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that climate change is likely to impact the agriculture and water resource management sector in Thailand significantly. The areas of concern include: reliability of water supply, the risk of flooding and droughts, impacts on health, agriculture, energy and aquatic ecosystems. Thailand is one of the world's major food exporters. It continues to rely heavily on rainfall as a major factor in the planning and management of irrigation projects and crop yields.  The agricultural sector takes up 70% of the nation's total water supply. Hence, any climate change, especially in terms of overall precipitation levels and distribution patterns, carries huge consequences for the agricultural sector.
A key challenge for effective agriculture and water resource management in Thailand is the lack of adequate regional climate models, collection, and distribution of spatial and temporal meteorological and hydrological data. Thus, medium- to long-term plans and strategies toward climate change adaptation are difficult to initiate. As meteorological uncertainties increase further due to climate change, it is even more important for Thailand to set up a climate data centre

Nationally Determined Contribution to promote a sustainable agriculture and approriate resource allocation, Good Agricultural Practise (GAP) and to safeguard food security. 
Context
Agriculture plays an important role in Thailand. More than 40% of the labor force (39 million people) is engaged with agricultural sector. To minimize the impact of climate change, several crop varieties with greater tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses are developed and introduced to the farmers. Rice with flash flooding tolerance and rice with blast and pest stress are good examples. In addition, agricultural practices, such as integrated pest control, irrigation system, and fertilization management, are applied to increase the efficiency of management. Looking forward to the future, crop production will face extreme weather, resource scarcity and environmental degradation. Existing applied technologies will not be good enough for the changes. Thus, technology development and technology transfer on the efficient use of resources are necessary to for the agricultural sector to cope with climate change, to increase productivity, as well as to meet the sustainable productivity goal of the country.
Support Provided
The primary objective of the CTCN assistance in this context is to enhance the capacities of Thai stakeholders in the knowledge and application of agricultural technologies that will help better manage the allocation of resources required for optimal crop productivity. The CTCN assistance comprised of two main activities:
Conducting a capacity building workshop with a range of in-country stakeholders on topics relevant to improving resource use efficiency through technological interventions.
Design of a pilot project to demonstrate real-time application of agricultural technologies for resources management.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Crop diversification and new varieties
Biotechnology for climate change adaptation of crops
Irrigation
Agricultural biotechnology (rice)
Remote sensing & GIS
Precision agriculture
Irrigation efficiency and information systems
Expected Benefits
The agriculture sector contributes around 53 Million Tonnes of CO2 (2011 data) of GHG emissions. Precision farming technologies, as targeted in this assistance, lower fuel and energy use leading to less carbon dioxide production. It also involves optimizing nitrogen fertilizer use, thereby helping to reduce the amount of nitrous oxide released from the soil. This technical assistance has a special emphasis on cassava production. Scientific studies indicate that the estimated total GHG emissions of cassava starch production per year in Thailand are approximately 10,500 MtCO2 eq. Precision farming technologies have the potential to reduce these by half to 5,250 MtCO2 eq.
40% of Thailand’s labour force is engaged in agriculture, amounting to around 22 Million people. Successful scaling up of this TA has the potential to help these people to adapt to climate change. Around 500,000 farmers cultivate cassava in Thailand. It can be estimated that one-fourth of them can start using precision farming amounting to 125,000 people.
Gender Mainstreaming
Twenty female researchers were involved in the project out of 56 participants. 100% of female participants indicated that they had significantly increased their capacities as a result of the training with regard to precision agriculture and resource-use efficiency.
Lessons Learnt
Lessons Learnt for this technical assistance
The technical assistance implementation faced hurdles from time to time because of lack of clarity on the proponent’s side with regards to some of the activities. It is important to flesh these out in detail as early as possible, and stick to these. Recommendation: The role of the point of contact from the proponent’s side is very crucial to ensure that the technical assistance proceeds smoothly. Careful thought must be put into identifying this person.
Lessons Learnt for related to climate technology transfer
With a wide gamut of available technologies, it is important to identify the most appropriate technology (even if the most suitable is not the most elaborate or accurate. Recommendation: Remember that technology is a tool. In some contexts, simple technologies are more useful than sophisticated ones.
One way to facilitate the sustainability of the technical assistance outputs is to link it with a GCF proposal. Recommendation: It will be worthwhile to link each technical assistance to a funding proposal.
Lessons Learnt related to the CTCN technical assistance process

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions by 33% below the projected Business As Usual energy emissions per capita by 2030, as well as to promote efficient water use practises in various sectors of the economy.  
Context
Due to effects of climate change, Zimbabwe has already started to experience water scarcity with effects on the industrial production processes and energy sectors. This unsustainable consumption of water resources is not sustainable given the dwindling water resources due to climate change. Climate change adaptation through efficient water utilisation in industry is a possible strategy that could ensure improved coping with the effects of climate change through improved production technologies and improved water recycling capability in industry. Major effort needs to be made in all stakeholder groups: company, government and public to raise awareness of the national importance of improved water management in industry, and its relevance to corporate goals.
Although most Zimbabwean companies claim to be energy and water efficient in their production processes, there is limited monitoring and measurement of water and energy intensity and comparison with international benchmarks. In general the practice of energy auditing, water foot printing and systematic emission reduction programmes are very low in most companies except for the purposes of meeting regulations.
Therefore, a Green Industry Initiative (GII) formulated by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in collaboration with Business Council for Sustainable Development Zimbabwe (BCSDZ) and Government of Zimbabwe offers opportunities for achieving an inclusive and sustainable industrial development in Zimbabwe through minimising energy intensity and specific water consumption in manufacturing enterprises. The Green Industry Project seeks to promote reduction of Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and facilitate Low-Carbon Green Growth in the industrial production sector through promoting climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, industrial energy efficiency, emissions reduction and renewable energy technologies, to include waste to energy projects.
The GII is a public/private partnership initiative between the Government of Zimbabwe, the BCSDZ and UNIDO.  The GIP agenda for Zimbabwe focuses on greening existing industries and creating new green industries which are energy and water efficient. The project will address both climate change mitigation and adaptation through improving energy efficiency, adoption of renewable energy technologies for productive uses efficient utilization of water resources as a climate change adaptation strategy.

An increased uptake of renewable energy technologies at industrial level will help to reduce emissions in line with the need to achieve the targets set in the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs). The improved water savings at industrial levels will facilitate improved water availability in the long term and ensure reduction in effluent due to minimization of water losses. Companies also stand to benefit through financial savings from energy and water savings at industrial levels. Other benefits include the improved occupational health and safety due to improved housekeeping of factories and minimization of water spillages. The project will ensure that a positive impact on human health, water and sanitation due to increased water availability is achieved in a mutually reinforcing manner. The most significant benefit is that the project will reduce water and energy intensity of Zimbabwean industries and ensure that other competing sectors requiring the resources e.g. agriculture, households and institutions can have access resources.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Affordable and clean energy, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, Climate action","Water efficiency in industry"

Nationally Determined Contribution to promote climate adapted crop and livestock development and climate smart agricultural practices
Context
The country faces a challenge in adapting its agriculture education and farmer training component to climate-smart technologies, that is, Climate-Smart Agriculture. The current curriculum is not including issues of climate change and the adaptation and mitigation component, and therefore puts at risk agriculture education, farmer training and agriculture productivity since most of the student who graduate from agricultural colleges end up working as agriculture extension workers to, largely, the newly resettled farmers who constitute the bulk of farmers in Zimbabwe.
Cognizant of the negative impacts of climate change on agriculture, on 25th and 26th July 2015, Ministry of Agriculture, Mechanization and Irrigation Development organized a National curriculum Workshop on agricultural education, to review the courses offered in all government-run agricultural colleges. The workshop agreed that there is an urgent need to mainstream climate change education climate-smart agriculture, and other issues, into the National Diplomas available in all agricultural colleges.
Assistance Requested
1. Developing a Climate-Smart Agriculture Manual for Agriculture Education in Zimbabwe:
The manual will be integrated into all national agriculture learning curricula and shall form a standard approach or intervention against climate change and promoting sustainable development. The main themes including in the manual which are important for Zimbabwe’s agriculture include but not limited to:
Definition of Climate Change
Principles of Climate-Smart Agriculture
Agro-forestry
Soil and Water management
Irrigation systems
Crop and Livestock production
Post-harvest Management and Value addition
Renewable energy and Energy management
Gender, HIV and AIDS
2. Training workshop on Climate-Smart Agriculture:
Facilitating (some logistics and most funding) the capacity building process and training events in Climate-Smart Agriculture. By conducting capacity building workshops to students, lecturers, and relevant stakeholders in agriculture education, CTCN’s technical assistance will also help further integrate agriculture education and the agriculture industry. This helps to integrate the manual into agriculture education with the buy-in of local stakeholders. Green Impact student teams and team patrons will also benefit from such a platform which provides a launch pad for students to take advantage of opportunities in agriculture whilst also contributing to socio-economic development of Zimbabwe.

	Livestock management
	
Expected Benefits
Medium-term impacts:
Increase in quality delivery of Training.
With capacity to deal with climate change through climate-smart agriculture, future extension workers, agriculture entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers will be better equipped to increase productivity and incomes, build resilience to climate change and reduce or remove greenhouse gases where possible.
Setting up of agriculture demonstration centers in all government-run agriculture colleges across the country.
Set up outreach programmes where students engage with surrounding communities to offer extension services under the Green Impact Student Footprints for Climate-Smart Agriculture (SFCSA) programme.
Increase in quality delivery of monitoring and evaluation tools.
With each year, as students continue to receive the theory and practice of climate-smart agriculture, there will be more positive results of the work done in capacity building and its transfer to agriculture production and across the value chain.
Increase in on-farm productivity and incomes, and resilience as a result of Green Impact student teams’ quality delivery of climate-smart agriculture to smallholder farmers across the country.
A notable reduction in on-farm greenhouse gas emissions as a result of Green Impact student teams’ quality delivery of climate-smart agriculture principles to smallholder farmers across the country.
Long-term impacts:
A sustainable programme that enhances student active participation in promoting climate-smart agriculture and transfer of climate-smart technologies to smallholder farmers across the country.
Increased agricultural productivity and incomes, increased resilience to climate change and reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emission. This translates to sustainable development and sustainable environmental management practices. 
Increased knowledge and awareness of climate-smart agriculture approaches benefit smallholder farmers to increasing agriculture productivity and incomes, resilience to climate change and significantly reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions where possible.
CTCN’s technical assistance will help to lower or remove greenhouse gas emissions in on-farm agriculture activities by smallholder farmers. By capacitating agriculture college student teams on climate-smart technologies which promote climate-smart agriculture, the students are able to transfer the knowledge to the smallholder farmers who are struggling to increase agriculture productivity and build resilience, but also, who are mainly responsible for land degradation and increase crop and livestock’s vulnerability to climate change.
Climate-Smart Agriculture practices such as intercropping with legumes, mulching, crop rotation, greater crop diversity and improving storage and processing, and improved feeding strategies, rotational grazing, grassland restoration, integrated crop and livestock, and manure management have significant benefits to sustainable agriculture and help reduce heat and water stress on crops and livestock.",,,"Zero hunger, Quality education, Climate action","Agroforestry, Community-based agricultural extension, Cropland management, Irrigation, Soil management, Livestock management"

Context
Tanzania’s population that has access to grid electricity is very low particularly in the rural settings, which hosts the larger proportion of the population. In rural Tanzania access to the grid is 6.6% of which the 4.6% electrified by the grid and 2% is electrified by the solar photovoltaic. The population connected to the grid countrywide by the year 2012 was 20.7%. The United Republic of Tanzania (URT) has admitted the inability to extend the grid to cover the entire country due to a diverse number of challenges that limit access. As a result, URT encourages the enabling of off-grid communities to access sustainable electricity using off-grid renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaic systems.
Most rural and sub-urban off-grid communities generally use kerosene for lighting (88.9% of rural households). Kerosene as used for lighting contributes to climate change through emission of greenhouse gases and black carbon particulates emitted from the lanterns. In addition the emitted greenhouse gases and black carbon particulates cause problems of acute respiratory diseases, cancer and heart disease.

Furthermore, by 2030, have developed new early warning systems and new hydrometeorological insurances, within the disaster risk reduction framework for the agricultural, coastal and health sectors, and for flood sensitive urban areas, infrastructure and other vulnerable regions. 
Context
Over the course of its history, the coastal areas of Uruguay have played a significant role in the country’s development. The coastal departments (Colonia, San José, Montevideo, Canelones, Maldonado and Rocha) currently account for some 70 per cent of the total population, 71 per cent of private households and a little more than 72 per cent of housing in Uruguay. In addition, they contribute 75 per cent of the country’s GDP and most of the places identified in the coastal areas (59 per cent) are predominantly involved in tourism.
Recent regional studies conducted for Latin America and the Caribbean demonstrate that the incidence of extreme sea levels increased between 1950 and 2008, with a greater magnitude and frequency being noted in the coastal areas of the Caribbean and Río de la Plata, with Montevideo specifically being classified as one of the continent’s most exposed cities. Sudden flooding has occurred in Río de la Plata due to a combination of meteorological and hydrological effects, the simultaneous occurrence of extra-high high tides alongside large, atmospherically-induced storm surges having raised the mean sea level (MSL) by as much as three metres above its usual height (0.91 m), leading to the stripping of beaches and dunes, damage to coastal infrastructure and risks to navigation.
The country has produced a National Climate Change Response Plan which highlights the importance of accurately identifying the impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation measures necessary for the coastal sector.
Assistance Requested
The ultimate goal of this assistance is to establish the vulnerability to and impact of climate variability and change on coastal areas of Uruguay. More particularly, the main objective is to analyse and assess the effects on the dynamic of beaches, dunes, coastal erosion, risk of flooding and harm to ecosystems, infrastructure and the population living along the coast, as well as to productive activities such as tourism.
Specific objectives:
Establish the changes occurring in the marine dynamic in recent decades (sea level, sea swell, wind, meteorological tides).
Based on climate change scenarios, estimate the foreseeable future changes in the marine dynamic.
Assess the effects that these changes in the marine dynamic may have on the different natural environments and human uses of the coast.
Conduct a climate change risk assessment across different temporal horizons and for different geographic or socioeconomic receptors.
Propose adaptation strategies and alternatives.
Establish the foundations for subsequent studies aimed at covering other aspects not considered in this study.
Develop the tasks of technological transfer, training and education associated with the project.
Generate indicators of impact, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the coastal zone.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Climate change vulnerability assessment
Coastal monitoring
Expected Benefits
In principle, the aim is to submit at least three detailed projects during the 2016-2017 period that consider different spatial scales, in line with the priorities noted in the NAP. These scales will cover departmental and regional aspects:
Stretches of coastline of between 30 and 50 km with a spatial resolution of approximately 25 m for analysis. In this case, the study will need to enable the identification of vulnerable coastal ecosystems and infrastructure (beaches, dunes, river mouths, ports, urban settlements, tourist resorts).
Stretches of coastline of around 500 km with a spatial resolution of between 5 and 10 km. In this case, the resolution will need to be lower than before and so the characterization of the different relevant coastal elements will depend on the part of the coastline, its geography and the information available in the country.
The level of detail that needs to be achieved in this kind of study will require the cooperation of the country’s various authorities and research bodies. This involvement will need to be formalized during the preparatory stages of the Response Plan, particularly in relation to providing the data that will be used to identify the vulnerability of the coastal area (see table of main stakeholders). This exchange will not only strengthen institutional capacities to manage information for decision-making but will also generate a management network for top-down/bottom-up adaptation.
The country’s academic institutions will have a tool which, in the future, could be improved and adapted for the identification of impacts, assessment of vulnerabilities, risk management and implementation of adaptation measures for Uruguay’s coastal areas.",,,"Decent work and economic growth, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action","Coastal zoning, Downscaling of climate model projections, Climate change monitoring"

Recently, the most important projects considered as the first priority for IRAN’s government is to construct some desalination plants and power plants. In fact, Iran as a developing country needs a lot of power and freshwater supplies because of its domestic and industrial consumptions. Therefore this country intend to solve this problem in order to provide electrical energy and freshwater for different applications. According to the recent studies obtained from Iranian Ministry of Energy, this country will encounter the problem of power and water shortage owing to its high demand and decreasing the annual rainfalls. On the other hand, Iran has many precious supplies such as oil and gas fields (one of the most hydrocarbon-rich areas in the world) and salt water resources (Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf). Hence, Iran’s government decides to utilize these worthwhile supplies to construct some desalination plants with capability of power generation in Mega Watt scale.
Another advantage of this project for Iran is using the waste gas in factories such as the steel industries. Also, waste gas containing calorific value can use instead of natural gas in steam power plant and cogeneration of fresh water. Therefore, in addition to the advantages above mentioned this project leads to mitigating climate change and emerged as an eco-friendly project because both of fresh water and power generating separately caused GHG emission and constructing desalination plants including power generation can be emerged as an effective tool for reducing GHG emission and climate change mitigation. To clarify this problem, according to the reports of Iran’s government (Ministry of Energy), this  country  imports  electrical  energy  (approximately  4000  million  KWh/year)  from neighboring countries such as Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan. Furthermore, despite the number of population and the demand for freshwater has increased considerably during recent years, the annual rainfalls have been decreased about 20% than long-time average and also this country will encounter water crisis in the near based on the authentic sources.
As a result, Iran’s government is concentrated to solve this problem immediately via construction of desalination plant including power generation in Mega Watt scale in the appropriate locations. In this regard, it is compulsory to cooperate with international reputation companies having a wealth of experience in this type of projects. All reputable companies are welcome to apply for this project if they are interested in constructing this kind of plants.
Assistance requested
Generally, desalination plant including power generation units in Mega Watt scale has a high efficiency approximately 90% enabling us to consume much less energy regarding the production of freshwater and power. Additionally, the environmental pollution of these plants are much less than conventional ones; thus in spite of using energy much effective, we can protect our environment by reducing pollution. By taking into account all the mentioned reasons,  Iran’s  government  is  interested  in  cooperating  with  international  reputable companies having an excellent background in engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) on these plants. The Iran’s policy is to collaborate with some companies in order to reach its significant goals mentioning as follows:
Primary feasibility studies to find best location for establishment of these plants.
Designing plants with different capacities (water and power) in Mega Watt scale.
Procuring all the Key equipment.
Constructing of the whole plant including the process units and utilities.
Technology transfer.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Seawater desalination
Expected benefits
In one hand, lack of water resources in Iran would cause to develop industries in the Persian Gulf and Oman sea coastal area. On the other hand, source of fresh water is very limited in Iran. So, construction of plants which is produce fresh water and electricity simultaneously is a huge advantage of this suggestion because these products are definite need for developing industries in Iran. So, construction of desalination plants with capability of power generation regarding the production of power and industrial/fresh water is one of the most significant projects for Iran’s government, because these productions are necessary for this developing country to reach its long-term goals such as population growth, industrial and agricultural development.  Furthermore,  this  country  possesses  abundantly  two  main  and  primary resources including fuel (gas & oil) and water supplies (sea water); Hence this is conspicuous that Iran has excellent potential to build this type of plants. To elucidate the importance of this plant, some benefits are briefly mentioned as follows:
Solving the problem of water and power shortage for industrial applications. 
Saving energy consumption efficiently to desalinate and generate power simultaneously. 
Producing less pollution than the conventional plants. 
Balancing the electric distribution network.  
Developing agriculture and industry all over the country.

This Technology Transfer Advances Benin's
Nationally Determined Contribution to promote and improve access to renewable energy sources for the purpose of safeguarding forest resources and reducing the vulnerability of populations to climate change.
Context
Like most sub-Saharan African countries, Benin has low electricity access rates among households with 31.03 % at national level, 58.02 % in urban areas and 6.8 % in rural areas (2014 data).The Government of Benin began a rural electrification program in 1993 with the goal of increasing access to electricity for rural populations. This program consisted of installing solar photovoltaic systems in small isolated communities as an alternative to extending the national electric grid. In addition to solar and hydro resources, studies have shown that Benin also has good small wind resources in its coastal areas that could be a source of power to rural populations in those areas. However, thus far, wind resources remain underutilized in Benin with only a few existing facilities. In order to accelerate and expand renewable energy based electrification Benin aims to also utilize its wind resources to complement solar, hydro and biomass energy. In spite of the carried out studies that concluded sound potential for small scale wind in coastal areas deployment of the technology has not taken off. Stated as reasons for this were a lack of commitment to plans and strategies, a general lack of interest in wind energy, as well as very limited capacity both within the public and private sector to identify and address current barriers. One known barrier is the cost of small wind technology, which is why investment activities have been limited. To respond to this the request aims at creating a local industry using materials and components that can be sourced locally and therefore easily and cheaply, as well as easy to maintain.
CTCN Support Requested
This CTCN technical assistance aims to identify key barriers to and opportunities for a local manufacturing industry of small wind turbines and the creation of a market with potential for growth by:
Providing advise to Benin on the question of whether or not kick-starting a local wind manufacturing and deployment market by first analyzing feasibility of local manufacturing of equipment.
If the results of the feasibility study are positive, a second phase of the intervention will produce recommendations to Benin as to how to create a manufacturing market as well as how to spur the installation of small wind turbines through capacity building, policies, regulations, programs, and other measures.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
On-shore wind
Small-scale wind
Expected Benefits
The following are intended impacts if the small wind manufacturing and deployment action plan were to be implemented by the Benin government:
Short term:
Expand access to reliable electricity supply for rural populations to specifically support income-generating activities and provide improved educational and health services, as well as gender benefits
Generate green jobs at the local level
Medium term

Promote and generate green jobs at the regional/national level.


Give impetus to wind energy which is struggling to take off in this country.


Ensure that there are attainable benefits for players involved in the sector of technology transfer.


Create a passion for renewable energy, and wind energy in particular.

Long-term

Le contexte
Comme la plupart des pays d’Afrique subsaharienne, le Bénin est à la traîne en matière d’accès à l’énergie électrique. En effet la majeure partie de la population de ce pays est privée d’électricité comme l’indique les taux d’accès des ménages en 2014 : 31,03 % au niveau national, 58,02 % au niveau des centres urbains,6,8 %pour les zones rurales. La consommation d’énergie par habitant en 2012 était de 0,435 tep (ces chiffres sont obtenus  à partir des données statistiques de la DGE). Après son évolution de vingt - huit (28) places en 2014, notre pays a connu en 2015 une nouvelle avancée de quatre (4) places lors du classement Doing Businness 2016 réalisé par la Banque Mondiale. Malgré ces avancées, il est à noter qu’il a régressé d’une place quand on s’intéresse au volet énergie du dernier classement [1]. Les populations vivant loin des centres urbains comme le montrent les chiffres restent les plus défavorisées.
Pour leur développement durable, la préservation de leur environnement et leur autonomie énergétique, ces populations doivent bénéficier des formes d’énergie qui répondent aux défis des changements climatiques à savoir les énergies renouvelables. Dans ce contexte, notre requête s’oriente vers la filière  éolienne dont l’exploitation sur un site venté s’avère rentable. Les populations rurales vivant dans la région côtière du Bénin peuvent bénéficier de cette forme d’énergie car d’après les études menées à ce jour, cette zone est  la plus favorable pour son exploitation avec des vitesses du vent comprises entre 3 et 6 m/s. Ces vitesses ont été mesurées à seulement 10 m de hauteur (données fournies par l’Agence pour Sécurité et la Navigation Aérienne en Afrique et à Madagascar (ASECNA) [2].  
L’exploitation de l’énergie éolienne au Bénin est à ce jour à l’étape embryonnaire. En effet les projets réalisés se limitent à quelques installations individuelles ou à titre expérimental comme l’aérogénérateur installé par la Société MIERT International au Palais des Congrès de Cotonou ou celui du Laboratoire des Energies Renouvelables et Systèmes Energétiques de l’Université d’Abomey – Calavi. Une étude de faisabilité accompagnée d’un plan d’action pour la fabrication des composants des aérogénérateurs de petite puissance constitueront des leviers qui peuvent permettre à cette filière de sortir de la léthargie dans laquelle elle se trouve actuellement dans notre pays. La réalisation d’un projet pilote constituera la phase pratique des activités.
Assistance demandée 
L’assistance technique demandée va consister en la réalisation d’une étude de faisabilité sur la fabrication des équipements d’un aérogénérateur de petite puissance au Bénin. Cette étude va s’appuyer sur les réalités locales (non-exécution des plans et stratégies mis en œuvre pour l’exploitation de l’énergie éolienne, manque d’engouement pour l’énergie éolienne, mais aussi les expériences concluantes enregistrées dans la sous – région (cas des petits aérogénérateurs conçus et fabriqués sous l’égide du Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) au Ghana par exemple [9]) ;
L’élaboration d’un plan d’action pour la mise en œuvre efficiente du projet. Ce plan d’action permettra une vulgarisation de la technologie à une échelle plus élargie dans le cadre d’autres projets ;
L’appui au Centre Béninois de la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique (CBRST) et à l’Ecole Polytechnique d’Abomey – Calavi (EPAC) qui seront renforcés en vue de la mise en place de la chaîne de fabrication des aérogénérateurs ;
La formation d’acteurs locaux dans le cadre d’un projet pilote sur :
La conception des installations ;
la fabrication des différentes composantes des installations (composantes mécaniques, composantes électriques …) ;
L’installation de l’aérogénérateur fabriqué au profit d’un centre d’intérêt social (école, dispensaire ou maternité) situé dans une localité favorable à l’exploitation de l’énergie éolienne.
La maintenance usuelle de l’installation
Avantages attendus

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 relative to the Business-As-Usual scenario and in line with its sustainable development agenda, and to mainstream climate change adaptation into the water sector.  
Context
Water Services Trust Fund (WSTF) is a Kenyan State Corporation established under the Water Act of 2002 with a mandate to assist in financing the provision of water services to areas of Kenya which are without adequate services. WSTF operates under the newly formed Ministry of Water and Irrigation Services. WSTF goal as set out in the Strategic Plan (2014-19) is ‘assured water resources availability and accessibility of water and sanitation by all’. WSTF has been financing water services, sanitation and water resources investments in Kenya across the 47 counties (Ref: Water act 2002)
Kenya’s national income is derived from environmental and natural resources agriculture, mining, forestry, fishing, water supply, tourism and energy - and the majority of people live in rural areas where they rely on these resources for their livelihoods. Currently, unsustainable traditional agricultural practices, over-exploitation of water resources, a rapidly growing economy, population growth and climate change put these limited resources under severe stress. Sustainable management of water resources and rangelands are particular issues in the dry areas of northern Kenya. Green growth, natural resource management and environmental sustainability have become vital for sustaining growth, jobs, and maintaining community resilience
WSTF has financed a number of rehabilitation or non-functional water projects. Green project designs would have been robust and require less operation and maintenance thereby having investments focusing on new/undeveloped areas. WSTF is in the forefront of ensuring sustainable water sector financing within the water sector which informs the need to approach the Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN) and request assistance in; undertaking a feasibility study on green technologies and their sustainability in the water sector in Kenya; Exploring the potential for Public Private Partnership within the water sector in implementing green technologies.
A new Water Bill has been developed to align the sector to the 2010 Constitution. As per May 2015, the Bill is in Parliament awaiting the Third Reading. In the Water Bill, WSTF is retained as the Water Sector Trust Fund and as the water sector financing mechanism with a mandate to provide conditional and unconditional grants to Counties and to assist in financing  development and management of water services in marginalized and underserved areas, including:
Community level initiatives for the sustainable management of water resources
Development of water services in rural areas; and
Development of water services in the under-served low income urban areas
From the inception of WSTF, 1,363,305 beneficiaries have been reached with an estimated value of Kshs. 1801 per person through financial support to approximately 533 no. Water Service Providers (WSPs) and Community Based Organizations projects. In terms of water resources management, a total of 402 no. WRUAs have been funded to implement catchment activities covering an average area of 40,200 Km2. (Ref: WSTF -Urban Programme Concept-  4th Quarterly  internal report FY 2014/2015, Page 6 and 7)
Water Resources User Associations (WRUAs), Water Service Providers and Community Based Organizations in Kenya, involved in development and management of water resources and water supply schemes, are faced which challenges of inadequate water quality and quantity to sustain domestic supply and other competitive uses like agriculture and industry. This is attributed to implementation of unsustainable technologies that are; Expensive to operate and maintain thus uneconomical; Inadequate and cannot withstand the climate change adverse effects thus affecting reliability of water and sanitation services and integrity of water/soil conservation structures. Current use of electricity or fossil fuel in pumping water and reliance on rain water harvesting technologies with little capacity to withstand evapotranspiration/ flooding challenges caused by recent extreme erratic rainfall patterns in Kenya, remains a live challenge in realizing impacts of WSTF financing to projects.
Generally, the inability of water infrastructure to withstand floods and dry weather conditions needs to be addressed through research and implementation of appropriate green technologies and overally to achieve climate adaptation within the water sector in Kenya.
CTCN Request Supported
The CTCN support services will be to collaborate on research on green technology for water services and water resources management with the research institute in Kenya, after which the CTCN will assist in developing a more intensive and in-depth research strategy, as well as in finding funding for continuing research.
The assistance will focus on four core activities:
Development of an extensive water green technology research strategy on existing and potential low cost water green technologies to be adopted within WSTF programmes.
Undertake a feasibility study on the appropriateness of available green technologies for different ecological/environmental contexts of Kenya, including piloting green water technologies in the various ecological zones in Kenya.
Through capacity building workshop, strengthen WSTF and other climate change and green water technology national actors’ institutional capacity in identifying PPP opportunities and engaging the private sector in the water sector
Develop a Public Private Partnership business model on the deployment of green water technologies in Kenya based on the feasibility study and identify funding opportunities (national and international co-investors, national and international funders).
Through the technical assistance, WTSF and CTCN will have contributed to the efforts to build a more climate resilient Kenya in water scarcity and access to water.
The CTCN will contribute to the development of a WSTF green technology strategy that will incorporate aspects of renewable energy, development of climate proof green technologies for improved water services, sanitation and water resources in Kenya and PPP mechanisms. It will engage national, regional partners and international policy-makers in a dialogue to reflect on potential multi-adaptations and policy gaps in water research. Assistance by the CTCN will strengthen WSTF’s scientific and technical capacity to promote and finance sustainable water green technologies. It will work with the Water/ Energy research institutes, as well as other regional and international centers for water research, WRUAs and WSPs on the basis of existing knowledge, scientific advice and practical evidence. Other possible research areas could include focusing on private sector engagement in financing green technologies in Kenya with specific focus on the water services and water conservation.

Nationally Determined Contribution to ""reach 27% of electricity generated from renewable sources of energy by 2030"".
Le contexte
L’Algérie a adopté en 2011 un vaste programme des énergies renouvelables et de l’efficacité énergétique (PEREE). Ce dernier, mis à jour en 2015, vise la production de 22.000 MW d’électricité d’origine renouvelable à l’horizon 2030, dont plus de 60% (13.575MW) serait d’origine solaire photovoltaïque (figure 1).
Etant donnée son ampleur, ce programme pourrait, en fait, être également vu comme un projet structurant du fait qu’on peut y fédérer des actions essentielles pour un développement durable du pays. Il pourrait faire l’effet d’un catalyseur pour mettre en place un tissu industriel utile et créateur de richesse, tout en faisant contribuer efficacement une bonne partie des ressources humaines à divers niveaux de qualification y compris celui de R&D. En effet, les technologies liées au secteur de l’énergie solaire photovoltaïque, restent relativement ouvertes à une bonne maîtrise par les pays en voie de développement et sont de surcroît créatrices d’emplois accessibles à un large profil de métiers.
C’est dans cette perspective globale que s’inscrit la mission du Centre de Développement des Energies Renouvelables (CDER) en tant qu’institution publique, chargée entre autres de contribuer à la mise en oeuvre du programme algérien des énergies renouvelables, notamment en matière de choix technologique, techniques et de formation. Pour cela et afin de favoriser l’émergence d’un authentique tissu industriel apte à assurer une intégration massive de toutes les potentialités locales, le CDER a procédé au lancement d’un projet fédérateur visant la réalisation d’une centrale solaire photovoltaïque au sol de 1 MWc, connectée au réseau national de distribution d’énergie électrique. Dans cette optique, un partenariat a été monté avec les principaux acteurs économiques publics et privés nationaux activant dans le secteur, où le CDER est appelé à jouer à la fois le rôle de maître d'ouvrage et d’oeuvre de l’ensemble des travaux. C’est principalement sur ce dernier volet qu’un accompagnement du CTCN est fortement souhaité pour assister l’équipe du CDER en charge, au lancement du projet sur des bases professionnelles en termes d’industrialisation et de gestion technique.
Assistance demandée 
L’assistance technique visée peut se résumer à une demande d’accompagnement en matière d'étude, conduite et mise en oeuvre effective d’un projet industriel dont seul l’objectif final est actuellement clairement défini.
Il s’agit en fait de la réalisation d’une centrale photovoltaïque de 1 MWc, sur un site déjà identifié, à proximité du périmètre urbain de la nouvelle ville de Boughezoul, située à l’épicentre de la région des hauts plateaux (170 Km au sud d’Alger).
La formulation, le lancement et le suivi de l’ensemble des travaux ainsi que la contribution à leur mise en oeuvre concrète sur le terrain, constitue en fait un vrai challenge pour l’équipe désignée pour la prise en charge de ce projet d’envergure pour le CDER. Les connaissances scientifiques liées au sujet étant supposées acquises par les chercheurs algériens, ce sont surtout les concepts menant à leur mise en oeuvre dans le cadre rigoureux d’une installation opérationnelle qui font défaut. Ce nouveau champs d’intervention étant encore loin d’être suffisamment maîtrisé, sachant les nombreuses contraintes à résoudre en matière de fiabilité, protection et autres aléas de fonctionnement. Encore faut-il savoir planifier correctement la mise en oeuvre des solutions technologiques préconisées et leur intégration lors des différentes étapes de réalisation, ainsi que la nature des protocoles de tests progressifs de validation.
Etant convaincus que ce profil de compétences ne peut être que le fruit d’un long processus que seule l’expérience du terrain peut aider à forger, notre objectif est de parvenir à un niveau de maîtrise pouvant aider la partie algérienne à impliquer d’avantage ses propres ressources humaines et matérielles dans le domaine.
Pour cela, une mise en contact des membres de l’équipe du CDER en charge du projet avec des experts pouvant les accompagner dans des domaines précis liés à la conduite technique du projet, serait hautement appréciée. En tout état de cause et afin de donner le maximum de chances d’aboutir à un apport de connaissances utiles et à la hauteur des attentes réelles, il est jugé important de procéder à un cadrage encore plus précis du contenu de cette requête. Ainsi, sans prétendre cerner tous les besoins en la matière, surtout ceux liés à la prise en charge des aspects industriels selon les normes requises, on peut néanmoins identifier certains thèmes révélateurs des déficits de compétences appelés justement à être comblés à travers cette requête :
Contraintes spécifiques à l’implémentation aux normes industrielles des principales solutions techniques liées à la chaîne de conversion photovoltaïque connectée au réseau.
L’étude technique du générateur et évaluation de la faisabilité de son raccordement au réseau électrique existant.
Optimisation du choix de l’architecture physique finale de la chaîne de conversion en fonction des caractéristiques opérationnelles imposées en fonctionnement normal.
Mise en conformité des protocoles de fonctionnement ou de reconfiguration en cas d’apparition de défauts particuliers liés au réseau connecté.
Calibrage et intégration optimale des dispositifs de protection dynamique et statique nécessaires pour l’ensemble de l’installation
Ordonnancement des travaux de réalisation de l’ensemble de l’installation électrique sur site (câblage, pose des équipements, tests préliminaires…) et autres aménagements spécifiques (prise de terre, protection contre la foudre…).
Conduite des essais de raccordement au réseau et tests d’évaluation de la centrale avant sa réception finale.
Il est à noter que seule une assistance exclusivement liée à la mise en oeuvre technique du projet est prioritairement considérée pour le moment. Il va de soit que les autres volets d’expertise nécessaires à une conduite rationnelle de ce type de projets, (dimensionnement global, génie civil, impact environnemental, optimisation des coûts, …), sont tout aussi importants et seront abordés ultérieurement.
Bénéfices attendus 
Etant donné le manque d’expérience évident dans la conduite en EPC de projets d’une telle envergure en Algérie, la concrétisation effective de l’assistance technique telle que formulée constituerait un pas appréciable vers un développement industriel équilibré du pays. Plus encore, s’agissant d’un accompagnement dans un domaine aussi stratégique que la maîtrise des techniques liées aux énergies renouvelables, cela ouvre la voie à une intégration efficace des potentialités locales au processus de développement durable déjà lancé. En effet, c’est avec un apport significatif de l’industrie nationale dans le secteur, que la mise en oeuvre du plan d’action préconisé dans le cadre du PEREE, serait doublement bénéfique pour le pays. C’est en tout cas dans cette perspective globale, que s’inscrit dorénavant la mission du CDER, dont la présente requête est une authentique illustration de l’ambition affichée.
Ainsi, l’aboutissement effectif de l’accompagnement technique tel que formulé, contribuerait à façonner sur des bases solides la passerelle tant souhaitée et qui a fait défaut jusqu’ici en Algérie entre le mode industriel et celui de la recherche appliquée. Rien que de ce point de vue, il est prévisible que la dynamique induite ouvrirait des perspectives prometteuses dont bénéficieraient à moyen et long terme tous les acteurs pouvant contribuer à l’émergence d’une activité économique saine du pays.
Sur un autre plan et à court terme, cela renforcerait la motivation des chercheurs du CDER à mobiliser d’avantage leurs ressources en les recentrant autour d’activités ayant une valeur ajoutée palpable et relevant pleinement de la définition centrale même de leur mission. Dans cette optique, le savoir faire cumulé pourrait prédisposer à moyen terme le CDER à devenir à son tour un pourvoyeur crédible d’assistance technique pour la conduite de projets similaires. Sur la même base, le lancement de cycles de formations spécialisées, peut également être considéré afin de doter le marché du travail d’une main-d’oeuvre qualifiée dans le secteur d’intérêt, reconnu pour être hautement créateur d’emplois.","National Renewable Energy Laboratory, The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research","National Renewable Energy Laboratory, The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research","Affordable and clean energy, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, Climate action","Solar PV"

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its emissions in the energy sector by 25% below the business-as-usual scenario.
Context 
Ecuador produces about 11,114 Ton/day of municipal solid wastes (MSW) at national scale.  This amount corresponds to an average per capita production of 0,72 kg/person/day.  The data show that as average, 59 ± 14 % of the MSW are made of biodegradable residues and in some municipalities this percentage could be as high as 80%.  The anaerobic decomposition of this MSW fraction generates methane and CO2 as main residual gases which are freely released to the atmosphere.
During 2010, 160 from a total of 221 Autonomous Decentralized Governments (hereafter municipalities) disposed of its MSW at open air rubbish tips, therefore producing severe ground, water and air pollution.   The remaining 61 municipalities have sanitary landfills with different degree of technical management.  Moreover, only 94 municipalities have differentiated garbage collection systems at the source.  Inadequate waste disposal at municipalities is the origin of environment pollution especially in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, toxic leachate and soil deterioration.  This could be interpreted as a combination of lack of awareness, weak local capacities and or lack of financial schemes.
Most municipalities are unable to improve their MSW disposal systems due to high costs of implementing adequate solutions, lack of technological alternatives and limited technical advisory for implementing specific technology alternatives.  This problem hampers reuse and recycling of MSW as well as its exploitation as energy source and/or fertilizer. Additionally, a gap between the sources and users of technology for MSW treatment has been identified, which is related with funding and technology transfer mechanisms. It is intended with this measure to take advantage and to enhance locally-developed technology with potential to contribute to an environmental problem, identifying sound technology transfer mechanisms and possible funding schemes to pave the way for an efficient diffusion and deployment of these technologies.
Requested CTCN Response
INER has developed local technology of gasifiers and biodigesters suitable for the characteristics of local MSW with the potential to make use of it with energy purposes while reducing the amount of wastes that is disposed into landfills or rubbish tips at the same time.  These technologies could have an important impact on solving the MSW problem described above and also on the promotion of locally developed technology use. The proposal considers the elements described below: 
Identification and analysis of technical and administrative aspects. This activity is oriented to identify the administrative and technical characteristics of the MSW management that are required for a prompt implementation of demonstrative pre-commercial pilot plants. According to the characteristics, needs and capabilities of each possible implementation site, it will be defined the correct technology (gasifiers and/or biodigesters).
Development of enabling mechanisms. This activity could be described as a combination of three sub activities:
The first one is focused on the identification and operation of technology transfer mechanisms. This stage implies the recognition of the enabling framework and barriers for technology transfer to the municipalities, therefore, new or improved mechanisms from the source (INER, who has developed local gasifier and biodigester technologies) to the users should be proposed.
The second sub activity comprises the identification of financial mechanisms for technology adoption and sustainable operation due to the fact high costs are identified as one of the most important barriers for technology adoption and improvement of MSW treatment systems. Consequently, one important action within this proposal is to identify the possible range of financial mechanisms and the design of innovative mechanisms that permit municipalities match its own economic resources with other sources of monetary flows. Within this activity, other relevant national and/or international actors, as well, as financial sources should be identified. Strategies for converting a potential waste-to-energy project implementation into a continuous waste management process will also be evaluated.
Finally, the third sub activity will consider the implementation of demonstration plants that will show the technical advantages and benefits of different waste management alternatives that are applicable to the local characteristics. This action will pave the way for a proper and coherent diffusion and technology transfer process and also will solve specific waste management problems by applying the technology developed by INER.

Dissemination and scaling-up strategy.  This activity could also be split into two sub activities called energy management model and market development for technology diffusion.
Within the energy management model, the most suitable and economic forms of energy use from biodigesters and gasifiers will be identified according to the characteristics of municipalities. The types of energy vectors from these technologies are biogas, syngas, liquid fuels or electricity; therefore, several different alternatives of energy usage will be analyzed taking into account the socio-economic aspects of each municipality. Sustainability strategies previously identified will be analyzed into the management model proposal.
Market development and technology diffusion consists of developing several information mechanisms, which highlight the features, benefits and economic viability of the new technology. Workshops and visits will be conducted with focus on users, industrial units, policy makers and other stakeholders. As a part of the diffusion strategies, field visits will be organized to other users and stakeholders in order to show benefits of technology under operation. Field visits will encourage and enable the stakeholders to actively get involve in promotion measures for wide dissemination of the technology.

Building local capabilities. Technical and administrative staff in charge of MSW management should enhance their knowledge, awareness and technical capabilities in order to implement adequate MSW treatment systems, as well as, gaining insight into the possibilities of using MSW as energy and other valuable materials source.
It is important to promote locally-developed technology (e.g. gasifier local technology developed by INER) since they are adapted to the particular characteristics of MSW. This will allow that municipalities generate proper internal processes for adopting and implementing new suitable technologies and treatment alternatives by their own initiative.  Some examples of these processes could be: garbage sorting at the source, diffusion campaigns and enhancement of productive entrepreneurship for energy usage and/or utilization of residual fertilizers. These alternatives will be also evaluated as technology transfer options.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Energy supply from waste
Integrated Solid Waste Management
Biogas power
Expected benefits
This measure seeks to implement a bridge between demand and supply of technology for MSW management.  Normally these technologies are too expensive or too sophisticated to be operated for the municipalities.  Locally developed technologies have the potential to reduce costs of implementation and operation.
Additionally, this measure will contribute to the following benefits:
Minimizing the amount of MSW that are disposed of in open air garbage tips or sanitary landfills.
Minimizing the emission of greenhouse gases that are produced during the biodegradable fraction decomposition of MSW.  These gases are freely released to the atmosphere.
Generating and strengthening local capacities at municipality level for technical treatment of MSW and hence, reducing diseases, contamination and GHG emissions.
Contribute to the technology diffusion and transfer by putting attention on adequate, locally developed technologies for MSW treatment.
Contribute to the use of MSW as a source for recycling, reusing, energy generation or fertilizers production. This could help to identify and implement productive entrepreneurships at local level.
Give support to the municipalities to identify and apply to financial mechanisms for technology adoption and implementation. 
Potential additional aspects:
Creation of proper job opportunities specially for poor people that are nowadays involved in an informal and unsecure way in the MSW treatment.
Reduction of potential diseases for the population and other problems associated with wildlife and nature due to improved waste management and reduced residues quantities.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Responsible consumption and production, Climate action","Biogas power, Energy supply from waste, Integrated solid waste management"

El contexto (Context)
De acuerdo al Inventario de Gases de Efecto lnvernadero para el periodo 1990 - 2006 , en el Ecuador el , ' sector agricultura es el sector que genera la mayor cantidad de emisiones de Gases de Efecto Invernadero (GEI) (Metano - CH4) a nivel nacional'. Por tanto, es prioritario para el Ecuador trabajar en alternativas para la mitigación y adaptación del cambio climático en este sector, por lo que el aprovechamiento energético a partir de residuos ganaderos es una alternativa viable de mitigación en las condiciones de desarrollo del país. La utilización de residuos ganaderos se enmarca en el desarrollo de buenas prácticas de manejo en la ganadería que favorece la adaptación al cambio climático. Para el Ecuador, la conjugación de medidas que aporten a mejorar la capacidad de adaptación y a su vez reduzcan gases de efecto invernadero es un eje fundamental en la planificación sobre cambio climático. El uso de residuos ganaderos es un ejemplo claro de que esta conjugación es posible en las condiciones del país.
Asistencia solicitada (Assistance Requested)
El MAE busca la asistencia del CTCN en la elaboración de un análisis donde se detalle el modelo de gestión necesario para la implementación de proyectos de aprovechamiento energético y la puesta en práctica de este modelo en la provincia de Santo Domingo, donde se implemente un proyecto de aprovechamiento energético demostrativo, el cual servirá como objeto de estudio para posterior escalamiento a nivel nacional y desarrollar un posterior Programa Nacional de Aprovechamiento de Biomasa.
Existen esfuerzos previos a nivel de asociaciones que están operando adecuadamente, sin embargo se espera escalar este modelo a nivel provincial y posteriormente a nivel nacional al ser replicado en todas las provincias del país y así tener un mayor impacto. Dentro del desarrollo de este modelo se espera abordar aspectos socio-económicos, articulación entre diferentes actores para definir competencias, temperatura, aparato productivo, beneficios, diseños, estudios de factibilidad y aplicación final mediante tecnologías asociadas.
Adicionalmente, se espera poder realizar una valoración económica de los beneficios de la aplicación de tecnologías de aprovechamiento energético de residuos e implementar este modelo con un enfoque comercial, para fomentar el autofinanciamiento y el cambio de la matriz productiva, minimizando la intervención gubernamental con recursos fiscales.
Beneficios esperados (Expected Benefits)
Con la asistencia del CTCN, se espera generar un análisis que sirva como insumo para la planificación de gobiernos locales y que incluyan el aprovechamiento energético de residuos como una alternativa viable para incidir en la mitigación de la emisión de GEi que generan el cambio climático. Al evitar la emisión de GEI utilizando energías alternativas en el sector agropecuarias se espera obtener beneficios adicionales por el uso de estas tecnologías que inciden en la reducción de desechos líquidos vertidos en las ríos cercanos, contribuyendo a la mejora de la calidad del agua en las zonas que sean intervenidas.
En el largo plaza se espera que este modelo sea replicado y tenga un nivel de penetración nacional, donde las beneficios y co-beneficios del uso de este tipo de tecnologías mejoren sustancialmente la calidad del agua donde se generan residuos agropecuarios, mejoren la calidad de vida de las usuarios al proporcionar servicios energéticos en sectores rurales donde no exista conexión al sistema nacional interconectado y que adicionalmente representen un aporte importante en la reducción de GEL.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Decent work and economic growth, Climate action","Biogas power, Gasification of waste, Household biogas, Methane emission mitigation of ruminants, Soil management, Manure management"

Introduce renewable energy sources in the existing district heating systems and to construct new district heating systems fuelled by renewable energy sources.
For more detailed information on this techology transfer, please refer to original project documents under the documents section below.
Context
Banja Luka’s district heating network (DH), the second largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, relies on high cost crude oil and experiences significant energy losses during transmission and end-use. This causes major costs to the city and district heating company, and unnecessary GHG emissions. Boilers used in the heating system are on average 35 years old and lose up to 60% of generated heat, while poor insulation means up to 40% of supplied heat is lost in the district’s buildings.
CTCN Support
The CTCN, together with partner United Nations Environment Programme, conducted a city-wide analysis to assess the status of the district heating network and energy efficiency, building efficiency, appropriateness of current heat productions sources, and the financial situation including current tariff levels and customer connections rates. The assessment recommended measures to establish an environmentally, technically and financially sustainable district heating system, with a focus on: 
Construction of new biomass boilers to reduce heavy fuel oil consumption and generate heat with sustainable biomass (cheaper, renewable and locally available)
Rehabilitation and replacement of key components in the distribution network to cut heat and water losses and reduce electricity consumption; and
Switching to consumption based metering and billing for improved quality of services and customer confidence.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
District heating and cooling 
Insulation in buildings
Expected Impact
Immediate impact
By leveraging a relatively small technical assistance investment, the CTCN was able to provide the city of Banja Luka with a strategy for significantly upgrading its district heating as well as for financing the implementation of the proposed changes.
The proposed CTCN strategy has attracted funding interest from different stakeholders. 
Investments in the modernisation of the heating infrastructure and the partial write-off of existing debts. 
This technology solution generated interest from Serbia in requesting similar technical assistance for the city of Belgrade.
Medium term impact
Improved sustainability of Banja Luka's district heating (DH) system.
Reduction in procurement cost of crude oil and fuel consumption by up to 27% for Banja Luka's DH system, saving €4.5 million a year in crude oil expenditure and 20,000 tC02 annually, while retaining wealth in the local economy encouraging local job development.
Economic and employment benefits for the local community through the use of domestic energy resources such as biomass.
Benefits for women and children, who spend more time at home in general, in terms of: 1) access to cleaner, safer and reliable heating system, 2) reduced domestic chores related to space heating, and 3) reduced incidence of carbon monoxide poisoning and accidental fire.
Development of a new energy tariff system at municipal level to improve efficiency, protect fuel poor and ensure business model is sustainable and attractive to the private sector. Subject to feasibility results (i.e. business plan) and thus availability of funds, heat meters will be installed in residential and commercial buildings.
Long term impact
Diversification of energy sources (from crude oil to biomass and/or geothermal) and the development of co-generation DH plants, leading to emission reductions of up to 80,000 tC02 per year and improved air quality in city.
A reduction in overall energy requirements and associated GHG emissions stemming from the city's space and water heating operations.
Improved operational efficiency of the district heating company, through the process of knowledge transfer and capacity building.
The establishment of Banja Luka as a forerunner for further DH energy efficiency initiatives across Bosnia & Herzegovina.

Provide guidance on national policy, regulatory and legal frameworks necessary to support the adoption of low-GWP, higher-efficiency equipment 
Introduce natural refrigerant systems to Chilean market and demonstrate effectiveness in reducing ODS and GHG emissions to policy-makers and facility owners 
Improve awareness of stakeholders regarding potential refrigeration technologies and their benefits
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Shift to coolants and refrigerants with lower GWP
Food preservation
Expected Results
The project has increased the awareness of companies in this relevant Chilean sector about the impact of the refrigeration systems on climate change and the current and upcoming regulation that will limit the use of HCFCs and HFCs as refrigerants. Consequently, the project has prepared the ground for an effective phase-out and phase-down of those substances in this sector in particular, but also in the entire Chilean industry.
In addition, it has provided the Government and public entities with relevant information on the current use of refrigerants in this sector and also on the measures to increase the share of zero- and low-GWP alternatives in this and other industrial sectors. Therefore, the project will help the country in its future international commitments under the Paris Agreement and the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Locally, the project will contribute to the current Clean Production Agreement between the ASCC and the agro-industry (the so-called “APL III”).
Finally, by assessing the opportunities to introduce the refrigeration technology based on CO2, Chile may be one of the first countries in the region to adopt such an state-of-the-art technology, which would be a good example for its neighboring countries. In this regard, we recommend to consult the report on the replicability of this technology produced under the third component of the project to better understand the impact of the project in the region.
Anticipated co-benefits
Energy efficiency: a reduction on the energy consumption of the companies subject to this project and other similar industries will be encouraged based on the designs of conversion.
Mobilization of funds: one of the companies subject to this design of conversion has already expressed its interest in investing in the CO2 technology. Besides, the Government is planning to undertake pilot projects for conversions into this technology under the frameworks of the HCFC Phase-out Management Plan and the future strategy for the phase-down of HFCs.
Employment: the trainings for technicians and trainers on the CO2 technology will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge on this area, which may match the future demand of technicians for the installation and maintenance of such systems by companies of the industrial sector.
Lessons Learnt
Lessons Learnt for this technical assistance
The essential factor contributing to the success of this project was the synergies among all parties involved. The combination of the expertise of the Ozone Unit on refrigeration systems, the experience of ASCC with the agro-industry and the willingness of the target sector to learn about this topic channelled by Chilealimentos has been crucial for the implementation of all components and the achievement of the expected results.  
Recommendations: There is still room for increasing the role of educational entities in projects like this one, where there is a component on training. In the case of the survey on the use of refrigerants by the companies of the target sector, there is still an important amount of information to be obtained about the small companies, which may consume higher ratios of HCFCs and HFCs than the medium and big ones.
Lessons Learnt related to climate technology transfer
Among the low-GWP refrigerants for industrial systems identified in the assessment of the first component, ammonia is already well known and largely used in the country. On its turn, the CO2 technology for industrial refrigeration is at an initial stage in developed countries, and almost unknown in Chile. The opportunities for this technology to be introduced in the country are linked to the upcoming regulation for the reduction of HCFCs and HFCs, the safety issues linked to the use of ammonia and the bigger energy efficiency gained with CO2 systems. The challenges are mainly related to the skills of technicians in Chile to install and maintain such systems. The barriers relate to the capital costs of the technology and the lack of incentives in the current regulations and policies. 
Recommendations: The establishment of a longterm training programme for technicians on the CO2 refrigeration technology is highly recommended. Considering the future phaseout of HCFCs and the phasedown of HFCs under the Montreal Protocol, it may be convenient to incentivize from the Government the conversion to zero- or lowGWP and highly energy efficient refrigeration technologies in the private sector.
Lessons Learnt related to the CTCN technical assistance process
The CTCN TA in Chile has proven to be an effective tool to build synergies among different entities that have a common goal. This has been the case during the inception phase and during the implementation. 
Recommendations: There is still room to improve the distribution of roles and tasks within each of the entities involved.

Context
Vietnam depends on coal as its main energy source, which comes either from the north of the country or has to be imported to meet future demand. Alternative, locally produced fuel sources could increase energy self-sufficiency and foster development of a local energy sector. Rice husk represents an enormous potential in terms of organic material to be used as an energy source.

Nationally Determined Contribution to improve energy use and waste management
Strategy for Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Management
National Strategy for Clirnate Change Adaptation and Mitigation 2013-2025
Context
Municipal solid waste (MSW) management is a growing problem in Mozambique. It is estimated that Mozambique generates approximately 2.5 million tons of municipal solid waste per year, of which organic waste constitutes approximately 60%. The final destination of solid waste in Mozambique is mostly open bins and uncontrolled dumpsites, with no or very little waste treatment. Simultaneously, the cement industry in Mozambique has been developing rapidly in recent years. The cement manufacturing process requires extremely high temperatures, which consume about ten times more energy than the average amount required by other manufacturing processes.
Technology Request
Mozambique's Ministry of Earth, Environment and Rural Development requested support in assessing the technical and financial feasibility for utilisation of municipal solid waste as refuse derived fuel (RDF) to power cement factories in Mozambique.
CTCN Support
The CTCN and partner UNEP DTU Partnership provided the following technology assistance, with focus on two urban cities: Maputo and Matola:
Development of technical specifications needed to develop an energy supply from waste 
Recommendations to cement factories on how to adapt their infrastructure to receive and utilise refuse derived fuel (RDF
Proposal for a monitoring and evaluation system to estimate impact in terms of greenhouse gases
Analysis of potential funding opportunities which might support financing of technology needs
This technical assistance involved collaboration with the Mozambican public sector including the Ministry of Earth, Environment and Rural Development; the Association of Municipalities; and the Fund of the Environment (FUNAB); the private sector (AMOR, 3R, Cimentos de Mocambique, and Carbon Africa) and the municipalities Maputo and Matola.

Expected Impacts
Short Term
Enhanced understanding of waste materials as a potential resources
Improved cooperation and synergies between the Mozambican public and private sector, improving dialog and further stakeholders in both sectors.
Medium Term
Cement kilns are able to use energy generated by the waste material
Decrease in consumption of non-renewable resources 
Longer useful life of waste disposal sites 
Creation of value added for the waste sector, due to revalorization of waste that has currently no value or use on the market 
Increase of local and national value chains, integrating the waste sector with the industry and energy market in the country 
Job creation 
Elimination of health problems of population living/working close to inadequate disposal sites 
Reduction of water pollution, which is normally caused by leachate from inadequate disposal of organic waste
Long Term
Reduction of greenhouse gases  from the waste and cement sector, through the replacement of fossil fuel with fuel made of municipal waste for the cement production processes and the environmentally sound treatment of organic and residual waste which will limit methane emissions
Creation of a circular economy in the country, representing a good case study to be replicated among other economic sectors in the country and the region.​
Gender Considerations
In Mozambique, the majority of the work force in waste management is formed by women who are active in informal waste collection and recycling. Frequently, women work in open landfills without any protective clothes, making them and their families more susceptible to health problems related to waste handling (respiratory and skin diseases among others). This technical assistance aimed to address this problem transforming informal waste picking on the streets and open dumps, to creation of formal jobs in the transfer and recycling centers, where women will be hired for work in formal waste management processes. While this process needs to be monitored and adjusted as needed, the intention is that this intervention can provide more socially inclusive jobs, appropriate working conditions, and higher and more stable incomes for women, creating enabling conditions to support women's empowerment in Mozambique. ","UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (UNEP-CCC)","UNEP Copenhagen Climate Centre (UNEP-CCC)","Affordable and clean energy, Responsible consumption and production, Climate action","Cement production, Energy supply from waste"

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce emissions by up to 21% by 2030 relative to baseline projections.    
Context
Senegal is one of the most industrialized countries in West Africa and has the fourth largest economy in the region (after Nigeria, Cote d'Ivoire, and Ghana), which is based on tourism, agro-industries,  mining and fisheries and benefits from a strong presence of multinational companies concentrated in urban areas. The country notably faces challenges related to the availability of affordable energy, as well as natural resource management and environmental conservation.
Four main sectors can be considered as high-potential value chains with strong comparative advantages regarding industrial capacity, value added and employment: agro-food, textile, minerals, and chemicals. Nonetheless, the Senegalese industrial base remains fragile, given the small size of production units and economic actors, high input costs, the underutilization of production capacity, and limited access to finance for local and national enterprises. In addition to these drawbacks, industrial production suffers significantly from its strong concentration in the Dakar area, hampering the potential of provincial economic zones, as well as from Jack of diversification and a system of product quality certification.
This notwithstanding, targeted actions undertaken recently have allowed to develop sparkling activities in particular economic zones and the development of high value-addition niches, including with considerable potential for export. Access to modern technologies requires additional attention and support. Technology innovation is key to strategic sectors that are potent in terms of wealth and employment generation.
Assistance Requested
Provide state-of-the-art technical assistance to unfold the potential in terms of green technologies in selected industrial agglomerations (either brown- or greenfield). The expert advice should allow to identify and implement opportunities related to improving resource productivity (i.e. doing more with less) and reducing pollution intensity (i.e. the environmental footprint).
The CTCN should assist in making resource recovery common practice. Materials, water and energy that are regarded as unproductive by one company can be turned into a business opportunity by another operating nearby (industrial symbiosis). There are numerous successful implementations of such concept and useful lessons can be drawn.
Detailed strategies and implementation measures are thus expected to deploy climate technologies, including those identified in the TNA, to boost industrial competitiveness. Options would include process upgrading and better management, resource substitution (incl. renewable energy) and recycling, with the aspirational objective of closing material, energy and/or water cycles within clusters of co-located users. Further measures pertain to shared logistics, collective energy generation system and/or waste and effluent treatment.
The assistance from the CTCN ought to include technical advice, as well as support to leverage finance to implement the measures prioritized.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Industrial symbiosis
Expected Benefits
Removal of barriers to the deployment of climate technologies deemed priority.
Significant savings for enterprises by improving resource productivity and waste valorisation through the targeted implementation of climate technologies and measures.
In turn, increased competitiveness of industries and job creation.
By capitalizing on the studies and first experiences, it will be possible  to develop a real  industrial  ecology  approach  for the  design  and the implementation  of new industrial  parks  across the country.

Indonesia's Technology Needs Assessment in which anaerobic digestion is identified as a technology option. 
Context
Indonesia is the world’s largest crude palm oil producer and accounts for approximately 60% of world palm oil production. An inevitable outcome of its production is the generation of considerable waste, including empty fruit bunches (EFB). While bio-waste conversion to energy through burning is currently being utilized, the high EFB moisture content creates an energy drain on the process. Anaerobic digester technologies, which transform EFB into biogas and organic fertilizer, could prove a more appropriate technology in this regard. As a renewable energy, biogas can then be optimized as an electricity source. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the best anaerobic digester for EFB processing technology, especially related to large scale palm oil production. 
Technology request
The Indonesian research and academic institution University of Lampung and the NDE of Indonesia, based on requests from the palm oil industries, requested technology transfer, capacity building and identification of the most relevant technology for waste processing of empty fruit bunches (EFB), more specificially related to the best anaerobic digester technology for EFB waste treatment. 
CTCN Support
CTCN facilitated in a match-making role to connect the University of Lampung with CTCN network member in order for them to provide all required information and provide technology transfer on anaerobic digester technology. The network member has considerable previous experience in design and construction of Palm Oil empty fruit bunch-based anaerobic digesters in Malaysia and Indonesia. They currently have several pilot plants installed and operational in Indonesia and other countries.  
As part of CTCN's match-making role the CTCN facilitated meetings between the University of Lampung and the network member in view of providing a sustainable solution to the palm oil waste energy production through:
Mapping of existing anaerobic digester technologies for EFB waste treatment and propose most relevant examples 
Facilitating knowledge exchange through expert collaboration and capacity building
Providing support on the planning of an EFB anaerobic digester demonstration plant 
Relevant Technologies and Approaches

For further details please see Documents section below.
Expected Impact
Shift to more efficient EFB waste treatment 
Production of renewable energy and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
Creation of new business opportunities in power generation 
Increase in electricity ratio for remote areas
Gender considerations
Using anaerobic digester technologies for waste processing of palm oil residues such as empty fruit bunches is a more efficient way of utilizing energy compared to the current waste-to-energy practise of incinerating the residues, mainly due to the high moisture content of the EFB. The resulting products biogas and organic fertiliser can be of benefit to women in particular. Cooking with biogas reduces time spent on cooking considerably compared to using firewood or charcoal as cooking fuel, and can thus lead to important time saved for women and girls. Studies show that freed up time can be used to do additional activities such as animal management, improving farming activities, putting more time into gardening work etc. Furthermore, as women are often in charge of farming and agricultural practises, the use of organic fertiliser can be a useful addition to those practises to increase land productivity. A significant amount of the Indonesian population still lack access to household electricity. If biogas is used for electricity generation rather than or in addition to cooking, increased access to electricity can improve women's working conditions.  ",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, Climate action","Biogas power, Gasification of waste"

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce emissions by up to 21% by 2030 relative to baseline projections.    
Context
Senegal is a west african developing country where energy demand is growing fast ( 4%) mainly due to the demographic  and  economicic  growth.  At  the  other  side,  the  energy  supply  face  lot  of  difficulties  and  is
characterized by:
insufficient installed generationcapacities;
high level energy cost due to the important use of fossil foil for electricity production;
high energy dependancy of the country due to fossil foil imports (no local production);
not  efficient  use  of  energy  in  some  sectors  coming  from  not  efficient  appliances  processes and technologies.
Lot of investments are planned each year for generation capacities which are not environmental friendly (fossil fuel, coal) and if nothing is done at the demand side, these one will be increasing at the long run. Energy efficiency is one of the key component of the national energy policy. The potential is very high and the studies already done, show 43% of energy savings that is possibe to realise on energy demand. Industries represent only 0.2% of the consumers but 36% of the consumptions (2013) and the energy saving potential is very important since they mostly have !Deficient processes and equipements. An energy efficiency program dedicated to them was already designated and consisted of a group of 7 technologies to develop. But, this program needs to be developped for its implementation (more studies).
In order to develop and implement energy efficiency programs in the country (including the designed program for industries that can be replicated for some big services), the national energy efficiency agency (AEME) was created in 2011 and the government, under its policy letter for energy sector development of 2013, assigned to AEME an objective of 40% of energy savings by 2020 for the country. At this stage, the global studies of the program dedicated to industries (to replicate for some services) have been done but not the detailed one. And, due to its important technology transfert component (with new energy efficient technologies that are not well known in the country), it is worth to develop it because of the multiples benefits it can generate for the economy, the industrials and environment.
Assistance requested
The assistance that is requested consists on:
The development of an additional study and monitoring/evaluation tools: the available stud for this program is not detailed and didn't focus only on the proposed technology. Also, it didnt fully considerate the services for promotion of these technologies. The additional study will be a way to highlight analysis related to the project, constraints, required investment, detailed implementation strategy, appropriate monitoring/evaluation tools, financing scheme and resources recovery, environmental issues ;
capacity building for the project management: since the proposed technology is not well known in the country, for its effective promotion, the project team needs to be trained well in order to master the subject and be able to manage well the project;
technical advices on policies for the technology adoption : this will help the project management team to identify the other measures to undertake or to propose to the government in order to back the development of the project. Sometimes, policy measures are much more important for the adoption of some practices and technologies than demonstration and communication;
project development : this will help to prepare, for specific industries and services, the project documents for its implementation and the financial scheme for the required investments;
adaptation to the local context: cogeneration/trigeneration can be adapted to specific needs of industries and services in the country and also the fuel that will used can be adapted to the local existing materials. The adaptation of this technology to the local context will improve its benefits
The level of development of cogeneration and trigeneration systemsis very low in the country. They are not well developed because of many reasons: not well known, lack of engineering for their developmentfunding, etc.There is only 2 cogeneration plants implemented (in 2 slaughterhouses) and most of the industries or other sectors dont know these technologies. Some of them have heard about it but are not yet convinced because they dont know or master the technology and they also want to be sure of the benefits (savings) before investing important money on it. They also want to make sure of all the risks and how to overcome them before getting involved.
Then, what is needed for the deployment of these technologies in the country is detailed studies and demonstration from pilot projects. These one will help to prove that these technologies are well working and can be implemented correctly and give the expected benefits.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Fuel switch in industry
Trigeneration
Expected benefits
The program will be a way to introduce new technologies and develop existing ones (but not well known) in the country. These technologies are working well in some countries but due to lack of experiences in their implementation in the country, they are still undeveloped. The advantage of the pilot program is that, though demonstration, industries and services can see themselves that it works and be interested in investing in such technologies. There will then a transfer technology, at a wider level to mitigate climate change.
These technologies can be more affordable if local workforce is involved and trained in order to be able to implement and do installations maintenance.
Social benefits will be employment and new markets generation contributing then to the improvement of living conditions of some people. The impact on environment will mainly come from avoided energy production because of the energy efficiency. Since the production depends on fossil fuel, C02 emissions will decrease.
The proposed technologies are sustainable and will generate very long term effects: benefits will be easily conserved because it comes from technologies not from behavior or some other sources. At the long run, with a wider implementation of these technologies (which will become much more affordable) there will be much important impacts (in energy savings) on environment and populations.
There are also lots of financial benefits either for the government (public services electricity costs reduction) or industries (operating costs reduction).

Nationally Determined Contribution to decrease its greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, by the year 2030, relative to the business as usual scenario of 7 million metric tonnes CO2equivalent.
Context 
Approximately 56% of Mauritius’ electricity generation comes from 4 power plants making use of bagasse and coal (40.5 MW to 83 MW) and one power plant operating solely on coal (34.5 MW), using the grate-type stocker boiler technology.  Some 683,000 tonnes of coal and 1,000,000 tonnes of bagasse were used for electricity production in 2013.  The current utilisation of bagasse enables the country to save on the import of some 375,000 tonnes of coal, thereby preventing the emission of some 1,200,000 tonnes of CO2.  However, over the past decade, sugar cane cultivation has significantly decreased and along with it, the amount of bagasse.   Likewise, the amount of coal used for electricity production increased by 5% between 2012 and 2013.

Context
The transport sector in Bhutan is characterized by the dominance of road transport and accounts for the highest energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Bhutan, at 44%. The number of vehicles is also growing at 9-10% per annum and the consumption of petroleum products for surface transport is likely to grow 3 times the current level of petroleum product consumption by 2020. There are over 68,744 vehicles in the country as of September 2014. Out of this only a meagre 1% comprises of public passenger buses. There has been a significant shift from public transport to private vehicles as seen in the rate of registered vehicles on roads. This figure is expected to further increase in the coming years. Bad road quality and difficult terrain which hinders road expansion also adds to complications in managing transport. As the public transport system is not adequate, taxis and personalized vehicles serve the travel needs of the majority. This has resulted in traffic congestion and an increase in vehicular emissions.
CTCN Support
CTCN facilitated a South-South collaboration between National Designated Entities (NDEs) of Thailand and Bhutan, together with partner UNEP DTU Partnership, through a workshop that provided Bhutan’s participants with an overview of Thai experiences in Bangkok and Chiang Mai regarding public and intelligent transport systems, by experts from Thai private and public agencies. Through practical examples and case studies, the workshop enhanced participants’ knowledge on relevant technologies. The participants were also taken to field visits to observe the application of Thailand’s intelligent transport management systems and public transport systems, and to gain an opportunity to interact with experienced officials and engineers. The purpose of the CTCN assistance was to:
Develop and deliver public transport management training for application of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), for public transport officials and managers
Provide training to enable access to climate financing for implementation of ITS
Provide training in climate change, vehicular emissions and use of emissions testing equipment
Provide guidance on relevant technologies

Context
Despite being part of countries selected to benefit from UNEP’s project supporting TNAs (as part of UNFCCC’s country enabling activities) funded by GEF in 2004, Pakistan did not develop their TNA due to lack of necessary skills, capacities and expertise to conduct such process. Pakistan recently requested UNEP for support to implement its TNA and was informed that the country can still access the one hundred thousand US Dollars (100,000 USD/GEF funds) that were allocated for the country by UNEP under the project approved by GEF in 2004.However, since the initial rounds of support for TNAs between 1999 and 2004, the TNA methodology and process has been significantly enhanced in the context of the GEF’s Poznan Strategic Program on Technology Transfer which includes the provision of targeted financial and technical support to countries for TNA. The main novelty introduced in Global TNA project implemented by UNEP under the GEF’s Poznan Strategic Program on Technology Transfer between 2009 and 2013 was the inclusion in the TNA process of the development of a national Technology Action Plan (TAP)recommending an enabling framework for the development and transfer of prioritized technologies at the desired scale. The funding currently available for the TNA in Pakistan is insufficient for the country to benefit from the technical guidance and support from, UNEP, UNEP RisoeCenter and the regional centres that executed the Global TNA project (TNA Phase I) and are in the process of starting a new phase for 25 new countries funded by GEF (TNA Phase II).
Assistance requested
The international technical assistance provided by CTCN will ensure high quality and more satisfactory results from the country-led TNA process and enable Pakistan to also develop its TAP. The CTCN assistance provider would coordinate the implementation of the TNA/TAP process with the TNA implementing entity in Pakistan and provide:
guidance on setting up the national TNA team,
support for the development of Pakistan’s TNA/TAP workplan and budget,
technical guidance for the different activities required to conduct the TNA/TAP process,
training on the TNA process and methodologies, and
quality control.
This approach will enable Pakistan to receive the same support as the 25 countries that will benefit from the next round of TNAs funded by the GEF and implemented by UNEP.

Nationally Determined Contribution to implement specific actions aimed at increasing resilience in the country, under the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan and the sectorial plans
Context
Chile’s current and future economy relies strongly on its biodiversity to offer access to a wealth of terrestrial and marine natural resources. Biodiversity relates directly or indirectly to many relevant activities in the country such as fishing, agriculture, forestry, farming and livestock development, mining, water supply management and many others. Some activities are based on the extraction of valuable species with the end use of commercializing them as food products for national and international markets, others are dependent on so called ecosystem services or sustain themselves in scenic beauty and richness. Sectorial activities generally consist of development projects and interventions that frequently bring pressure or threat to wilderness areas or landscapes with determined biodiversity characteristics. These pressures and threats can be aggravated considering the effects of climate change on ecosystems and species. In this regard, a rigorously planned biodiversity monitoring network can allow for detecting changes in biodiversity and its relationship with climate, and is a fundamental component of structural action and policy decisions in Chile’s adaptation to climate change. A dynamic and periodic assessment of the state of biodiversity is essential to make informed decisions for safeguarding of biological assets. 
CTCN Support
The CTCN and its partners, the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center and World Agroforestry Centre provided assistance to Chile's Ministry of Environment in designing a national biodiversity monitoring network. In recognition of national capacities and the need for knowing national circumstances in order to work more efficiently, analysis was also provided by national institutions. The collaboration between local partners and international experts resulted in:
The architectural and conceptual design of a national monitoring network for biodiversity and ecosystems, and their responses to climate change.

Context
Refrigeration and air conditioning appliances (RAC) are rapidly spreading across Africa. As the electricity in most African countries is still generated through burning of fossil fuels, increased demand for energy results in increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With the use of highly energy efficient refrigeration and air conditioning devices and the substitution of high global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants with low GWP refrigerants and foam blowing substances, both GHG emissions and energy use can be substantially reduced. Alternative technologies are internationally available but not common in Africa. The Green Cooling Africa Initiative aims at establishing a prototype best practice approach for Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, and Namibia.

Lessons Learnt
Lessons learnt for this technical assistance
The Green Cooling Africa Initiative has been implemented successfully, as was recognized by the partner countries as well as other stakeholders of the project. GCAI with its innovative nature provided a unique opportunity for the participating countries to prepare for an early transfer to climate and ozone layer friendly technology in the cooling sector. The partner countries are now considering or are already implementing an inclusion of the RAC sector’s mitigation potential in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). As a consequence, the countries would be able to mobilise further financial resources for the relevant follow up actions. The outputs of the GCAI provide the basis for financial proposals. Furthermore, the potential regional replication of GCAI’s activities and results in other countries of the region was discussed during the regional workshops and a regional network between NOUs, NDEs and UNFCCC Focal Points has been established. As a result, other countries of the region are considering project implementation on the grounds of GCAI in their respective countries. Through GCAI, awareness has been raised about the importance of the RAC sector for the fight against global warming and higher energy efficiency, due to the sector’s high mitigation potential at comparatively low costs. Although the project was implemented successfully, some challenges and delays occurred during the project implementation. The contracting of the international and national consultants took longer than expected and in both countries GIZ faced some challenges regarding the inventory, whereas the data collection in Namibia proved to be more difficult than in Mauritius. In both countries, local consultants struggled with non-responsive industry members and some companies’ inability to provide historical data, due to non-existent or poorly managed databases. In Namibia, an additional fatigue could be noted in the industry, due to other surveys being carried out at the same time in regards to energy efficiency, which are also covering the RAC sector. Furthermore, companies of both countries were sometimes reluctant to give out information in fear of tax inspections.  
Recommendations:
The early inclusion of all relevant stakeholders, especially the industry members, has proven to be essential to the success of the project. Ideally, before the start of the data collection, a kick-off workshop is organised informing the industry, but also all important national ministries, such as Environment, Energy and Finance, about the inventory and objectives of the project. The early inclusion of the industry has the advantage that they prove to be more willing to support the project and its objectives. This is the case in particular, if they are given the space and time to voice their concerns and engage in a dialogue with their representatives in the Ministries. Additionally, the choice of consultant proved to be of high importance, as well as his/her connection to the industry. The local consultant needs to know the industry as well as national circumstances to a great extent and has to be capable to explain the inventory and questionnaires in detail to the stakeholders. Mistrust toward the purpose of the data collection can be partly avoided by the provision of a letter explaining the process of data analysis and emphasizing data confidentiality to the industry members. Experience shows further that custom data has to be treated with caution and should be verified via double-check with the primary data collected during the inventory and through consultation with stakeholders of the national RAC industries, due to potential double counting and different forms of measurement (e.g. units or kg).  
Lessons learnt related to climate technology transfer
Describe opportunities, challenges and barriers for the use and deployment of the technology or technologies supported by the TA. The objective is to identify specific success factors for technology transfer The successful implementation of technology transfer towards green cooling in the RAC sector with its specific needs depends to a great extent on market availability of “green” equipment, as well as on national policies and regulations favouring the introduction of green cooling technology. Even if the national RAC industry shows interest in transferring towards more climate-friendly and energy efficient technology, they often need additional incentives on a financial, as well as regulatory level. The opportunity that this moment in time bears for the technology transfer towards green cooling is based in the increase in regulatory requirements on an international level. The Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer has been or will be ratified by the majority of countries, pushing them to phase down climate damaging refrigerants (Hydrofluorocarbons). This will result in various changes within the cooling sector and can be used to push climate friendly and energy efficient cooling technology.  
Recommendations:
When trying to initiate a climate technology transfer, one has to consider national polices as well as the country’s specific market situation. Technology transfer can only be sustainable if conditions are created under which the transfer will stimulate the market regarding the supply with green technology and if national policies support the change and thus, the demand. Measures to support on an institutional level include amongst other tax reductions, subsidies or penalisation of obsolete technologies.  
Lessons learnt related to the CTCN technical assistance process
Lessons learnt regarding the CTCN process are related in particular to the adequate time planning for project preparation. Although the project was implemented successfully, some challenges and delays occurred before the actual start of project implementation. Due to the long contract negotiations between UNEP and GIZ, the start of the project has been significantly delayed. For this reason, when the technical proposal and time schedule were submitted to UNIDO, the project duration was reduced from 18 to 12 months. The project implementation period has further been reduced by another 2 months, due to a time lag between the submission of the technical proposal and the contract signing.  
Recommendations:
The consequential recommendation for potential further projects would be to start processes early and plan accordingly.  ",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Responsible consumption and production, Climate action","Shift to coolants and refrigerants with lower GWP, Efficient air conditioning systems"

Context
The economy of Ghana relies mainly on sectors as agriculture, energy and water, all these sectors are sensitive to climate change. Due to the limited use of irrigation in Ghana, the majority of the agricultural areas are very vulnerable to changes to the climatic conditions such as temperature and increased frequency of flood and drought events. The climate change Technology Needs Assessments report (TNA) from 2013 identifies the agricultural sector and the water sector as the main sectors in need of adaptation technology for climate change. 
Requested CTCN Response
CTCN support aims at providing adaptation methods and capacity for improved dry season planning taking climate change and variability into account. It is anticipated that specific focus will be given to the following technologies:
Data availability: Data availability is one of the key areas in any warning or information management systems. The use of satellite based data will be strengthened by methods for automated download and processing of relevant satellite data. The aim is to avail near real time satellite products related to the crop, climate and soil moisture conditions and impacts.
Climate forecast: Seamless weather forecasting functionalities enabling climate forecast across different temporal scales from short to seasonal to decadal periods will be explored, as well as skill assessment (including comparison with climatology based forecast).  The CTCN support will enable the use of climate forecast products and skill calculations applicable for Ghana.

Nationally Determined Contribution to ""Develop the National Strategy and Action Plan for Transitioning towards the Green Economy in Jordan 2016-2025""
Context
Jordan has recently completed its Technology Needs Assessment (TNA), but required capacity building for technical employees in the Ministry of Environment as well as relevant NGOs and consultancies, to develop these ideas into fundable proposals relevant to both domestic and international  funding. Jordan issued its Third National Communication (TNC) in 2014 supported by UNDP. The TNC contains about 43 project ideas for mitigation and many other ideas for adaptation. At this stage, the Jordanian Governmental Authorities have identified focus areas and compiled a large number of early-stage ideas for climate action. Nevertheless, in order to achieve transformational outcomes, the ministries have identified the key challenge of a lack of skills and knowledge in designing and articulating climate technology projects and project proposals.
Technology Request
The NDE of Jordan requested the CTCN support to help further develop the skills and expertise of their Jordanian officials in this area. The request included training and mentoring with a focus on project structuring, and will be relevant for a large number of sources, including domestically financed climate financing and the Green Climate Fund. 
CTCN Support
The CTCN and partner, UNEP DTU Partnership, provided the following technology assistance in Jordan:
Feedback on project idea notes (including by the Green Climate Fund National Designated Entity)

Context
Energy poverty is high in West Africa: over half of the population does not have access to electricity. While there has been an increase in capacity building in this sector, women, to a large extent, continue to be exempted from these interventions and are generally underrepresented in overall climate change decision-making and planning at all levels. In order to make greater strides, women need to be recognzied as active agents of change, possessing unique knowledge and skills that should be tapped in the development of energy and environmental resilience in the region.
Requested Assistance
To support building a gender-responsive, climate resilient energy sector, 13 West African nations asked the CTCN to provide technology and capacity building assistance in four strategic areas:
Review of energy relevant policies
Assist countries in undertaking gender audits in the energy sector and provide capacity building
Support awareness and knowledge exchange; Enable data collection as well as the publication of scientific articles about gender and climate change in West Africa in peer-reviewed journals
Investment promotion and business development: Develop gender-responsive project screening tools and mitigation/adaptation demonstration projects which can access climate finance

Context
The national Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) has been undertaken by the Department of Science and Technology in 2007. However, the KwaZulu Natal Province has noted that the National TNA only provides high level information which lacks the Subnational based information that can assist the Province to assemble technologies needed to reduce impacts of climate change within its jurisdiction. Hence, KZN province proposes a regional TNA, which will help the province to facilitate the transfer of the climate related technologies required to deal with the impacts of climate change within the District and also to contribute to the country's objectives on technological transfer. The Ilembe District Municipality proposes a local level TNA, which will help the district municipality to facilitate the transfer of climate related technologies required to deal with the impacts of climate change within the District and also to contribute to the country's objectives on technological transfer. In addition it is proposed that Ilembe District Municipality be used as a pilot site to develop an energy audit to be implemented by graduates from the local TVET colleges, a model that would be replicated across the province in all district municipalities.
CTCN Support Requested
Support the development of a provincial and local TNA that is aligned to the national TNA with a particular focus on the following:
Understand a variety adaptation and mitigation technologies available in the market and affordable for various sectors as well as their suitability to be implemented.
Develop methods to diagnose and design a range of climate technology transfer projects accessibility and acceptability from the prioritized technology portfolio and linking them to climate finance mechanisms.
The work should involve detailing technological requirements for the diagnostic and design methods that refer to implementation (orgware and enabling factors), accessibility (access to financing & resources), availability (service reliability & resource security) and acceptability (social & ecological improvement).
In order to fast track implementation of energy related technologies, assistance is required in developing methodologies for energy audits at local level that can be replicated across the province.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Technology Needs Assessment
Expected Benefits
The undertaking of the TNA exercise is aimed at understanding the available technologies within the province and to determine the need to import some technologies outside of the region, province or country. Therefore, the Subnational TNA will assist the province to develop baseline information on the available technologies within the region as well as developing a strategy on how to transfer technologies (from within the region, province, country or internationally) into the District Municipalities, which is currently not available. This will assist the District Municipalities and its family of Local Municipalities, to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases whilst at the same time adapting to the impacts of change.
The Energy Efficiency Strategy for South Africa 5 had set a national target for energy efficiency improvement which embraces the energy conservation of 12% before end of this year (2015). To achieve the goals set out in the Energy Efficiency Strategy, EDTEA as a lead agent on Climate Change issues in the Province proposes energy reduction programmes to achieve Government 's intended reduction of energy consumption by 10% at all government owned buildings and work stations used by government institutions.
The Province believes the 10% reduction of energy will in the long term contribute to the conservation of the environment by reducing emissions.

Context
Households, enterprises and institutions in the regions of Pwani, Lindi and Mtwara all use charcoal and fuel wood for cooking. The rate of biomass harvested from the forest to produce domestic energy is higher than the natural regeneration. In year 2012 the available wood that could be harvested sustainably was 46 million m3 per annum, however the consumption of the wood was 87.2 million m3 that created an annual wood deficit of 41.2 million m3. To meet the deficit, illegal harvesting targets protected areas.

Le Contexte 
Depuis environ deux décennies, au Bénin comme dans la plupart des pays africains, les calendriers agricoles recommandés dans les différentes zones agro-écologiques sont perturbés parce que les pluies utiles s’installent de plus en plus en retard. Les incertitudes sur l’ampleur des perturbations climatiques ne permettent pas aux services techniques de proposer de nouveaux calendriers aux producteurs. Les initiatives de programmes de pluies provoquées en cours d’expérimentation dans certains pays de la région autorisent l’espoir de réduire les poches de sécheresse pendant la période de végétation, mais ne résolvent pas le problème des dates de semis, de plantation et des opérations d’entretien et de récolte. Il s’ensuit des improvisations individuelles, mal maîtrisées et incompatibles avec tout effort de planification ou de prévision de la production agricole au niveau local, communal ou national.
Aussi, la variabilité interannuelle des pluies observée au cours de la période 1951-2010, révèle que sur l’ensemble du pays, de courtes périodes déficitaires alternent avec quelques courtes périodes excédentaires. Dans la région méridionale, les plus forts déficits ont été notés presque partout en 1977 et 1983 (années de sècheresse) tandis que les plus forts excédents pluviométriques remontent aux  Au niveau de la région septentrionale, les années 1958, 1977 et 1983 accusent les plus forts déficits pluviométriques tandis que les années 1988 et 1998 enregistrent, dans bon nombre de localités, les plus forts excédents pluviométriques. A l’échelle saisonnière, la situation se caractérise par certaines anomalies, se traduisant notamment par une forte concentration des pluies sur une courte période, une brusque interruption des pluies en pleine saison. Quant à la variabilité spatiale, elle reste en général moins marquée ou relativement faible dans les localités sises en dehors du littoral. En outre, avec les écarts, par rapport à la moyenne, sensiblement de l’ordre de -0,6°C à+0,8°C. La configuration des températures moyennes annuelles observées au cours de la période 1961- 2010, n’affiche pas une nette tendance à la hausse ou à la baisse. En somme, si à l’échelle annuelle, l’analyse du climat actuel ne révèle pas de tendances significatives dans les variations des précipitations, par contre l’analyse saisonnière fait apparaître de grandes différences durant la période postérieure à 1971.
Des efforts ont été faits à  travers la mise en œuvre des initiatives par exemple le  Programme Intègre d’Adaptation pour la Lutte Contre les Effets Néfastes des Changements Climatiques sur la production Agricole et la Sécurité Alimentaire au Benin (PANA1) a pu observer les  phénomènes météorologiques dominants, la situation pluviométrique, le bilan hydrique climatique, la situation hydrologique, la situation des cultures, la situation relative à l’élevage et la situation en matière de sécurité alimentaire  dans les communes de Malanville , Matéri, Ouaké, Savalou, Aplahoué, Ouinhi, Adjohoun, Bopa et Sô-Ava  qui font partir des quatre (4) zones agro-écologiques(ZAE1,4,5,8).

Nationally Determined Contribution that builds on the ambitious targets of the National Energy Efficiency Plan (2015-2036) to reduce the country’s energy intensity by 30% below the 2010 level in 2036.
Context
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA) estimated that about 2.1 GWh (2,100 million kWh) of electricity were consumed by street lighting nationwide in 2014; this is equivalent to 1.4 million metric tons of CO2. At the municipal level, it is found that public lighting services account for about 60%- 70% of the total electricity consumed by the municipality annually.
Street lighting technologies are improving rapidly and new products are introduced to the market every year. In addition to energy savings, most technology suppliers also claim benefits from lower operating and maintenance costs in the long-term. Although there is clear evidence about the benefits supported by positive results from PEA's demonstration projects, adoptions of energy efficient street lighting technologies at the municipal level have been still very slow. The key barriers that contribute to the slow uptake are the lack of confidence in investing these new technologies in a large scale and limited access to investment finance. Thus, raising confidence in saving results and long term performance of high energy efficient street lighting technologies, and designing project financing models that suit well with the Thai municipal context is the crucial step for promoting energy efficiency (EE) within the cities.
Assistance Requested
Conduct comparative techno­ economic assessments of different EE street lighting technologies; and
Design financial mechanisms for implementation of EE street lighting projects at the municipal level. This will catalyze the development and investment of practical and affordable EE lighting technologies in Thai municipalities and will complement the efforts done to date by PEA.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Efficient lighting
Expected Benefits
Medium-term impacts:
Enhance national capacities to implement EE street lighting technologies and practices
Long-term impacts:
PEA's cost of public lighting subsidy has been on a raising trend due to higher costs (of tariff purchased from the generation utility in Thailand, i.e., the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand or EGAT) and more extensive public lighting networks. Widespread improvement of public and street lighting systems and/or adopting more efficient street technologies in municipalities will help provide significant reductions in national energy consumption and GHG emissions from the current public lighting loads; including improvement of national energy security.
The expected output of the study is a report for EE street lighting for PEA, Thai municipalities and other third-parties. The report will include the following:
Comparative techno-economic assessment of EE street lighting technology design options
Financing models
Road map and recommendations
The outcomes shall include adoption of findings and recommendations by PEA, municipalities and other third-party stakeholders leading to greater investments in EE street lighting technologies in Thailand.

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its CO2 emissions per GDP unit by 30% below their 2007 levels by 2030, while decreasing poverty and inequality as well as continue advancing toward sustainable, competitive, inclusive and low-carbon development.
Context
The agriculture sector is an important contributor to the Chilean economy in terms of exports, jobs and GDP, but it is also responsible for 13% of the country´s GHG emissions, before accounting for GHG emissions from energy consumption related to production as well as a large consumer of water. Likewise, Chile is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change with the Agricultural and Forestry sectors being one of the most vulnerable sectors. Within this sector, micro, small- and medium enterprises (SMEs) make up the majority of producers. There is a low uptake of both climate mitigation and adaptation technologies by SMEs despite available financial instruments. This technical assistance sought to understand the barriers that prevent SMEs in the fruit, wine, vegetable, annual crop, beef, and dairy value-chains from implementing climate mitigation technologies, and climate adaptation technologies (which in this case, focused on efficient irrigation) and to propose solutions to increase the use of these technologies.
Requested CTCN Response
The requested CTCN technical assistance aims to evaluate the main obstacles to funding for investment in climate technologies facing MSMEs in the agrifood sector in Chile. Specifically with the aim to:
Analyze the main barriers to investment in clean technologies by SMEs in Chilean agri-chains and the potential interventions to overcome them; 
Identify the main opportunities to reduce the environmental impact and increase the resilience to climate change of selected agri-chains through the use of clean technologies;
Analyze the effectiveness of selected national and international financial instruments to help promote the uptake of clean technologies in SMEs; 
Propose recommendations to overcome barriers and increase the deployment of clean technology within the prioritized value chains through either the Clean Production Agreements or a potential Green Investment Bank; 
Build local capacity so that authorities have increased awareness of the challenges and the opportunities that could enable the replication of learnings to other agri-chains and potentially other sectors in Chile;
Engage with 31 private sector organizations throughout the assistance in order to better understand the local context, to validate findings, and to share project results.

The Government of Guatemala, therefore, requested CTCN support to strengthen the National Information System on Climate Change (SNICC). The main challenge for the implementation of the SNICC is related to the facilitation of the integration within institutions and the establishment of inter-institutional agreements between ministries and other organizations (including the private sector).
Requested CTCN Response
Define an indicator framework to enable government and private decision makers in Guatemala to make better decisions on investment for vulnerability, mitigation and adaptation to climate change;
Jointly validate the proposed indicators set and architecture and functionalities for an information system;
Develop a model for the information system including indicators protocols, required visualizations functions, data sources and software/hardware solutions;
Recommendation to ensure the implementation of an environmental and climate change information system using open-source resources and a flexible and modular system to integrate all running initiatives. 
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Environmental Information Systems
Open source climate data and tools

Nationally Determined Contribution to ""reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors (energy industrial processes agriculture, forestry and other land use waste) in order to lower its carbon intensity by 41 percent in 2030, relative to the base year 2010""
Context
Tunisia faces two key challenges to improve economic opportunities for a growing population, and to respond to environmental and climate pressures. Energy efficiency has therefore become a key concern across many sectors of the economy. Lighting accounts for 17 per cent of total nation energy consumption. As such, lighting technologies are an area of particular importance. 
CTCN Support Requested
The National Energy Management Agency (ANME) has requested capacity-building assistance from the CTCN for national experts (engineers, architects, etc.), covering innovative, low-GHG-emissions lighting system technologies and design techniques. The Government takes the view that a local, trained pool of energy-efficient lighting experts is essential if the country is to make a successful transition to energy-efficient lighting. The aim of the CTCN technical assistance is to create a local pool of high-level experts in Tunisia and to create a favourable environment for other energy-efficient lighting projects. It will focus on the development of energy-efficient lighting training materials and the delivery of training to around 100 Tunisian professionals. The trained lighting experts will then have a chance to act as trainers themselves, thereby further expanding the local skills pool, helping to secure the long-term viability of the national strategy, and promoting wider uptake of energy-efficient and low-GHG-emissions systems. The transition to energy-efficient lighting is expected to reduce GHG emissions by 370 kt CO2-eq per year on average.
Relevant Technologies and Approaches
Efficient lighting
Expected Results
The technical assistance is expected to deliver the following outputs:
Training materials for various programmes
Training materials for trainers
Delivery of training to at least 50 experts, who will then have the skills to train other experts in the sector
 
Le context
La Tunisie est confrontée à un double défi : améliorer les opportunités économiques d’une population en expansion et agir face aux pressions environnementales, notamment le réchauffement climatique et l’épuisement des ressources fossiles. L’efficacité énergétique est devenue ainsi un des sujets clefs pour tous les domaines d’activités.  Le défi à relever ici, consiste à bien mener cette étape de transfert du savoir-faire des meilleures pratiques et techniques respectueuses de l’environnement et limitant au mieux les effets du changement climatique. Ce qui devra permettre de créer en Tunisie des clusters de compétences nouvelles, qui bénéficieront des conditions propices à leur bonne exploitation et élargissement.
Assistance technique demandée
La Tunisie souhaite bénéficier d’une assistance technique de type renforcement des capacités en termes de technologies et techniques de conception des systèmes d’éclairage innovants et atténuant les émissions des GES. La formation de compétences locales est une étape clé pour réussir la transition nationale en cours vers un éclairage efficace. Cette assistance s’adressera principalement à une première sélection d’un groupe d’ingénieurs, d’architectes, de fabricants locaux et des acteurs concernés de l’administration, ceci dans le but de former des experts formateurs.
Bénéfices attendus
Le renforcement des capacités des experts nationaux en techniques innovatrices en éclairage économe devra permettre dans un premier lieu, de doter la Tunisie de ses propres compétences locales de haut niveau, qui pourront par la suite, répondre aux besoins du bon déroulement du  projet En.Lighten, au niveau de ses différentes phases, ainsi qu’au maintient d’une dynamique locale propice à la réalisation de tout les projets d’éclairage énergétiquement efficace tel que le programme ACTE, Alliance des communes pour la transition énergétique. Une des conséquences directes de ceci est la transition vers un marché d’éclairage, qui limitera les émissions des GES soit avec une moyenne de 370 kT CO2/an
Les experts en éclairage formés qui auront l’opportunité de devenir eux-mêmes formateurs et de contribuer à l’éclosion d’autres compétences locales et à la création d’un environnement propice à la viabilité du projet En.Lighten et à propager les systèmes économes en énergie et à faible taux d’émissions de GES

Context
The demand for charcoal and firewood is causing increased deforestation and degratation in areas of high population density (Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire, Dolisie, Nkayi, Ouesso, Gamboma, etc. This growing demand is due to the combined effect populations growth, lack of alternative energy sources available to low-income populations and inefficient production and use of charcoal. Carbonization rates are very low (10-15%) as the methods and charcoal burners are inefficient. The introduction of very simple techniques and training would make it possible to achieve higher yield  rates. As improved stoves are becoming more common, their adoption could reduce charcoal consumption by 20-30%. 
CTCN Support Requested
The CTCN was requested to support with:
Conducting a study on wood pellet and charcoal briquette production and biomass quantification as well as electricity generation from heat generated by combustion gases obtained from carbonization. 
Site analysis in terms of logistics and supply
Resource mobilization and investment analysis for an industrial charcoal cogeneration unit

Context
Large areas of the Dominican Republic are exposed to prolonged droughts. This is exacerbated by economic and social conditions that increase the urgency of analysing the country's vulnerability to climate change using tools to quantify susceptibility based on key indicators. A large proportion of the country's population lives in poverty and is highly vulnerable to effects of climate change. Impacts are also experiences in other areas such the coastal tourist zones, major river basins, health (dengue and malaria) and biodiversity. Despite the seriousness of climate change impacts, the Dominican Republic currently lacks technical and financial resources to reduce emissions or adequately adapt to climate change, going beyond isolated projects undertaken by civil society with international support. In view of this, the country aims to submit a funding proposal to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to reduce vulnerability and the impacts of climate change.

Context
In Bangladesh, due to sea-level rise, saline water intrusion in the coastal areas is increasing significantly while fresh water flow from the upper riparian countries is gradually decreasing. As a result, most of the land areas there are becoming saturated with saline water, and potable water is becoming more scarce. Collecting fresh water is becoming a major task for the women and children in poor households. Technical assistance is required to install desalination plants or other desalination technologies at affordable prices in the households. 
Low-cost climate resilient housing is another important issue concerning the coastal people of Bangladesh. The houses made of low quality materials can not last long. The durability of structures built using local sand, bricks and saline water is very poor. Low-cost salinity-proof structures are essential for the poor communities living along the coastal belt.

Nationally Determined Contribution and its identified adaptation need to intensify and increase early warning systems for intense rains and floods, and to implement structural and non-structural measures to face extreme events.
Context
Buenos Aires’ 400 km long coastline is dominated by sandy beaches, dunes and sandbanks. Sandy sediments are distributed along the coast thanks to long-shore drift currents transporting the sediments from the Colorado and Negro rivers. A growth in population and increased tourism has led to construction of new developments and resorts, transport infrastructure and development of port infrastructure. Due to the environmental fragility of the environment, the extension of the urban area has caused destruction of dunes as well as notable changes to the coastal sediment transport system. In addition, coastal erosion is being further exasperated by the effects of climate change which play a role in increasing sea levels and the frequency and intensity of waves.
Technology request
The Provincial Directorate of Hydraulic Engineering (DPOH) at the Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Services of the Province of Buenos Aires, requested support in accessing up-to-date technology and update on tools previously acquired for coastal morphology study and climate change monitoring. This assistance will ultimately support the development of a regional strategic plan aimed at defining comprehensive guidelines to mitigate the coastal erosion owing to natural processes and effects of human activity on the maritime coast.
CTCN support
The CTCN will provide Argentina with support for updating the tools previously acquired by the DPOH to study the coastal morphology and monitor the effects of climate change, with the aim of applying them to both assessment and adaptation processes. This technical assistance and final application of the technology will result in a product that can support the design and implementation of the Provincial Climate Change Policy.

Greater potential for the implementation of the National Policy for Adaptation to Climate Change based on the information that is generated and the territorial prioritization of adaptation measures, starting with the Tebicuary River Basin
Context
Paraguay has expressed its interest in reducing the adverse effects of climate change. As a landlocked country whose economy is predominantly based on agriculture, Paraguay is highly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Adaptation is an essential part of reducing these negative impacts. However, due to the lack of information and strategies to enhance resilience against climate risk, this country has faced environmental, social, health and economic problems. 
This technical assistance focuses on advancing in the field of technical studies, providing methodologies and practical tools to improve the management of watersheds and water resources in Paraguay, in a context of climate change and regional and global socioeconomic transformation.
The application of environmental flow (EF) tool which is designed in consideration with data availability in river basins of Paraguay represents the first phase of this assistance. This tool will assist the authorities to develop the ntegrated water resource management (IWRM) plans with the identification of relevant adaptive measures. The Tebicuary River Basin is proposed as an on-the-job training where associated data are used to train stakeholders to understand the EF tool. This river basin is one of the country’s largest basins and faces water management problems caused by all economic sectors and both rural and urban settlements.
The second phase of this assistance is to develop a framework for the formulation of an IWRM plan at river basin levels. The framework will underpin the development of IWRM plan providing the identification and implementation of control measures to adapt to climate change in river basins of Paraguay.

In Belize, priority economic sectors, such as agriculture, tourism, fisheries, coastal development, forestry etc., are facing climate-related challenges which pose significant obstacles to sustainable economic and social development.
Due to climate change, the agriculture sector is susceptible to fluctuations in water supply, agricultural production and growing season leading to crop loss and food shortage, and the spread of pests and diseases. Likewise, the forestry sector is beginning experience changes in growth patterns and productivity, habitat loss and decreased defence against pests, diseases and forest fires.
The Government of Belize aims to promote the development of agroforestry in areas where the pressure for agricultural expansion is strongest. This is necessary to maximize the economic output of forest buffer zones. The government also aims to promote sustainable management of private lands by developing the capacity of the public to initiate agroforestry activities. Belize holds great potential for implementing sustainable agroforestry policies and many efforts have been carried out to strengthen capacity in this regard. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the benefits of agroforestry and a need for assistance in developing a National Agroforestry Policy.

Togo struggles with very low energy access rates, especially in rural areas. Togo’s energy supply predominantly comes from traditional energy sources (biomass consisting of wood fuel and agricultural residue), which account for 70 to 80 percent of the national energy mix.  New and renewable energy sources (e.g. solar, wind) are only marginally represented in the country's generation facilities. In 2015, Togo prepared and submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which identified the energy sector as a priority area.
There are three major barriers to achieving the objectives set by Togo for access to Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All): 1) low national funding capacity (public and private) and heavy reliance on external funding from public and private sources; 2) a significant technology gap in terms of energy efficiency, energy management and development of new and renewable energy sources, and heavy reliance on the transfer of technology and expertise; and 3) poverty of the population, especially rural, and its effect on purchasing power. In addition, there is a lack of incentives for developing renewable energy and a lack of competitiveness in renewable energy markets compared with traditional markets.

Nationally Determined Contribution to strengthen water resource information systems for climate change adaptation and increasing the resilience of urban development and infrastructure. 

Context
Over the past 40 years, 33 extreme climate events have occurred in Lao PDR, the majority of which have been floods. The cumulative economic damage from these events amount to over $400 million USD. lt is predicted that these impacts will be exacerbated by climate change and urban areas in Laos are under particular threat from rainfall-related events. As flooding risks increase globally, it is becoming more and more apparent that natural drainage runs need to be preserved and enhanced, not destroyed. Engineered solutions require considerable capital investment and then require on-going maintenance. 
The Government of Lao PDR and UN Environment prepared a funding proposal for the Green Climate Fund 'Building resilience of urban populations with ecosystem-based solutions in Lao PDR'.

Context

The Government of Thailand, in collaboration with the CTCN, is preparing a Green Climate Fund Readiness proposal to facilitate achieving national targets for the building sector as defined in Thailand's Energy Efficiency Plan of 2015, its Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs), and in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
As per the NDC Road Map of Thailand, of the 115.6 million tonnes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions to be achieved from business-as-usual by 2030, 113 million tonnes are anticipated to be achieved through energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. Addressing GHG emission reductions from the building sector is imperative to meet the national targets. The national Building Energy Code (BEC) from 2009 serves as a vital regulation for the building sector as it defines the mandatory minimum energy standards for new buildings, yet to be constructed. Though the BEC standards have been mandated, the authorities have not been able to stimulate the building construction industry, project developers and investors in adopting these standards due to a lack of techno-economic recommendations on relevant cost-efficient technologies.
Requested CTCN Response
To contribute to the revision and re-submission of the proposal to the Green Climate Fund for upscaling investments in building energy efficiency for achieving NDC goals in Thailand. The activities undertaken were:
Providing technical assistance in determining the share of buildings in total GHG mitigation potential as committed in Thailand’s NDC through energy efficiency and integration of RE, and to develop a financial methodology to access the implementation potential of various technologies present in the market to enhance energy efficiency in building sector.
Carrying out institutional assessment of current enforcement mechanism present to enforce Building and Energy Code (BEC) in Thailand, suggesting and describing the roles of various agencies responsible for implementing BEC and summarizing the challenges in implementing BEC.​
In response to the above activities, a desk based research of available data in public domain was carried out and the following reporting provided: 
An overview along with diagram showcasing the potential of GHG mitigation from the buildings sector through energy efficiency and integration of RE
Overview of costing methodology to access the implementation possibility of various new technologies, enhancing the energy efficiency in the building sector
 
Expected Results

Revised proposal to the GCF (technical assessment, institutional assessment, evaluation and communication) which will support Thailand in gaining support to implement its Nationally Determined Contributions related to energy efficiency in the building sector.

Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its economy-wide absolute GHG emissions by 122.5 ktCO2e (21.4%) in 2025 and estimated 188 ktCO2e in 2030 (29.0%) relative to baseline emissions.
Context

The economy of Seychelles has been developing rapidly in recent years. In particular, the tourism industry, the main pillar of the economy, has experienced a boost with the number of visitors to the country increasing by 68% in 5 years from 208,000 in 2012 to 350,000 in 2017. To support this economic growth and the increasing quality of life of the population, the generation, transmission and distribution capacity of electricity has to keep pace. 
The Seychelles National Energy Policy aims to achieve 5% and 15% penetration of renewable energy by 2020 and 2030 respectively. It is important to have a holistic plan to guide the utility company in developing the electricity network in line with the transformation in the energy generation mix. The Electricity Masterplan therefore aims to coordinate the development of the electricity infrastructure in the near and distant future as demand grows.
A Water Masterplan has been completed recently, and the Public Utilities Corporation (responsible for the provision of electricity, water and sewage services) has learned from the process that an Electricity Masterplan will be an extensive and costly undertaking. It is envisaged that a loan or grant will be used to fund the development of the Electricity Masterplan. A few funding bodies have been approached already. However, they require terms of reference before fully considering the application.
Requested CTCN Response
The CTCN was requested by the Seychelle's Public Utilities Corporation and Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change to produce a detailed terms of reference (TOR) for the formulation of an Electricity Masterplan. The objective of the terms of reference is to engage a consulting firm to develop an electricity masterplan through analysis of existing conditions, undertake demand forecasting using relevant tools, identify the most economically viable means to reinforce, upgrade and expand distribution systems (including on- and off-grid), and develop a demand side management programme and building capacity within the PUC to meet the goals as defined in the Seychelles Energy Policy.
Expected Results
The vision of the Masterplan is to surpass the Seychelles Energy Policy Targets of 5% and 15% renewable energy by 2020 and 2030.  The Electricity Masterplan will also complement the implementation of the National Energy Efficiency Programme in terms of cogeneration possibilities and promotion. It would complement the target put forward in Seychelles' Second National Communication to the UNFCCC in its stated developments of technologies for mitigation against the effects of climate change in cogeneration, solar energy use, wind energy use, and reducing the losses in the supply of electricity in the current system.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

Context
 
Circular economy is an industrial model that is restorative by design and proposes that, instead of extracting natural resources, materials that have already been processed can be recovered and reused in various ways, thus protecting natural resources from over exploitation, an issue that is particularly sensitive in Latin America. The objective in this is to keep scarce, valuable resources in circulation for longer periods of time, promoting recycling and avoiding loss of materials. Achieving these objectives requires alternative models of business such as reuse, remanufacturing and product-as-service.
 
CTCN Support

To perform an assessment of the circular economy and to prepare a road map for each requesting country, revealing who are the key actors/interested parties and characterizing gaps and deficits, to serve as input for the collaborative construction of a roadmap on this issue, to serve as a management tool for the future implementation phase.

Expected Impact

●    Reduced use of resources needed per unit produced;
●    Reduction of the quantity of waste produced;
●    Reduction of the quantity of energy consumed. Reuse of raw materials reduces the amount of energy required to obtain an element that can be re-used in preparing the same or another product;
●    Development of new businesses and generation of new job positions. Latin America presently has a low rate of recycling and increasing the present rate will create the need to hire more personnel for the various tasks required in the different links of the value chain of each product prepared;
●    Promotion of innovation, because it is necessary to change the production model and update the production infrastructure, equipment and technologies, to process what is today considered waste (future raw material);
●    Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

Nationally Determined Contribution to implement an energy efficiency programme to reduce consumption by about 10% in 2030 and reduce about 89% of its GHG emissions at the 2030 time horizon compared to the BAU scenario. 
Context
Petrol and diesel fuel use accounts for about 63% of Namibia's total energy net consumption, followed by electricity with 17% net consumption. Namibia has limited oil reserves and depends highly on electricity import from other countries. A heavy reliance on such fuel has an obvious negative impact on emissions and environmental air quality. Namibia has a variable climate and experiences persistent droughts, unpredictable rainfall patterns and high temperature variability. This places Namibia at high risk for climate change-related impacts.
Namibia currently faces critical challenges to achieving market transformation towards energy efficient products including lack of information and awareness, limited labelling of appliances, and an absence of minimum energy performance standards. Namibia also lacks comprehensive policies for refrigerators and distribution transformers. Those with the lowest purchase price are the most ubiquitous, and these products tend to have inferior performance.

Up until a few years ago waste management in Belize simply included collection of garbage and transportation to an open dump site where the waste was burnt. Despite recent efforts at improvement, the management of municipal solid waste (MSW) remains a challenging sector for the country.   
Although about half the country is now being served by an improved MSW management system, a large portion of the population still relies on improper waste collection and disposal, with many open dumpsites still in use. Improper disposal is a threat to the environment and economy and can lead to deterioration of water, soil and air quality as well as deterioration of health of the local population and wildlife. The production of methane from landfill gas is one of the biggest threats, as this greenhouse gas is more detrimental than CO2.
Problems of waste management are often exacerbated by lack of knowledge on proper waste disposal, as well as attitudes and behavior concerning solid waste management.

According to the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC), about 320,000 Cameroonians, out of a total population of about 22 million, are already affected by climate-related disasters. The country is already facing an abnormal recurrence of extreme weather events.
These climatic changes observed in Cameroon during the last 50 years, are characterized precisely by the regression (-2.2%) per decade of rainfall since 1960, an increase (+ 0.7 ° C) of the average annual temperature, the recrudescence of extreme events throughout the country: droughts, more frequent and violent storms, floods and landslides, mudslides, falling rocks, landslides, etc. These impacts cause a drastic drop in productivity in fisheries, livestock, and agriculture, which are the key sectors of the local and national economy. All this coupled with the low level of knowledge of practical adaptation and mitigation methods makes communities highly vulnerable to these climate changes.
Some of the actions that can be taken include strengthening afforestation efforts, adopting and applying communication technologies, adopting effective accounting rules, resilient urbanization, etc. Several factors stand in the way of these actions, especially, the absence of data, the lack of training and information of the local populations in the techniques of mitigation and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, also the lack of capacity building of the municipal and local youths in the field.

Nationally Determined Contribution to result in an estimated total emission reduction of 38,000 GgCO2eq which translates to 47% (internationally supported efforts) against 2010 as a base year.
Context
According to the World Bank, under one-fifth of households (19%) in Zambia have access to electricity, with rural electrification as low at 3%, with electricity used primarily for lighting, biomass is readily available for another end uses. The adoption of energy efficient technologies beyond lighting has consequently been low in Zambia to date, where the focus in the residential sector is on first expanding access to electricity. Opportunities for the adoption of efficient products has been limited due to a range of reasons that include high levels of poverty and cultural factors, particularly in rural areas.
Due to high levels of poverty in Zambia and the Southern African region in general, the equipment markets are extremely price sensitive, with few consumers able to afford the first cost of equipment at all, let alone the incrementally higher cost of most energy-efficient product options.
Zambia benefitted from CTCN Technical Assistance along with other 9 Southern African countries: CTCN developed detailed country assessments for the five priority products (i.e. lighting, refrigerators, air conditioners, electric motors and distribution transformers). This assistance was required in order to more accurately define the current situation and the future objectives for climate-related policy actions.

Context
Eswatini is experiencing a rural energy crisis, where demand for household energy has outstripped energy supply. The combination of high demand, aggravated by low-end use efficiency (fuel wood is either used in open fires or in stoves designed for coal) has contributed to environmental degradation, rural poverty and rural energy shortages. Eswatini needs efficient policies and regulatory frameworks, as well as development of fiscal and financial incentives to encourage the use of energy efficient appliances. Like several other countries in the region, Eswatini’s energy policy is very high level and idoes not currently address any energy efficient technologies or regulations.
The CTCN previously developed detailed country assessments for 9 Southern Africa countries, including Eswatini, focusing on five priority products (i.e. lighting, refrigerators, air conditioners, electric motors and distribution transformers). This assistance will help to inform Eswatini's future objectives for climate-related policy actions.

Context
Nauru has a heavy reliance on imported fossil fuels, which is used for electricity generation, transportation and cooking. The costs of energy services become extremely high due to this dependency, which results in high carbon emissions and creates a huge drain of scarce funds, which is not sustainable for the long-term development of Nauru. Vehicle ownership is rapidly increasing in Nauru, subsequently increasing the emissions from the transport sector. There are no regulations related to emission standards or updated import regulations, vehicle performance and lifetime monitoring. An additional barrier to climate-resilient decision making is the lack of transport baseline information, which limits effective tracking and monitoring of fuel efficiency and other climate-relevant transparency metrics.  To reduce Nauru's reliance on fossil fuels, the country seeks to transition to a better fuel source or improved technology.

Observation of the countries in the Commission of Central African Forests (COMIFAC) area indicates that the demand for energy wood (wood charcoal and firewood) is and has been (both in the past and at present) a direct cause of deforestation and forest degradation in the Congo basin. Nearly all households in the countries of the Congo basin, as well as other African regions, still use energy wood as their main source of fuel for cooking and heating. Alternative energy sources are either going through a stage of symbolic experimentation and not being promoted (solar energy) or are being produced in low quantities (electricity, fossil fuels).
This request is based on the request for the implementation of an industrial-production project for wood charcoal and associated products by the Republic of the Congo.

Just over one fifth of households in Lesotho have access to electricity. The adoption of energy efficient technologies beyond lighting has consequently been low in Lesotho to date. Opportunities for adoption of efficient products have been limited due to a range of reasons that include high levels of poverty and cultural factors, particularly in rural areas.
Lesotho already participated in the workshop, organized by the Climate Technology Centre and Network, on leapfrogging to energy efficient lighting, appliances and equipment. The need was identified to look at the potential for increasing the energy efficiency of products by providing a technical market assessment of current conditions and policies.
Lesotho’s energy policy articulates efficiency goals at a very high level, whereas regulations designed to realize the goals are lacking.

The Kenyan economy is dependent on the performance of the Agricultural sector which directly contributes about 25% of the country’s GDP and about 27% indirectly through linkages to agro-based industries and the service sector.
Based on Kenya’s National Adaptation Plan (NAP) 2015 -2030, out of 47 counties, 23 are vulnerable to drought, 22 counties to landslides, and 35 counties to flooding. Simulation of future climate change scenarios based on various models indicate a mean annual temperature increase of 1.5 to 3.0°C by 2050.
Kenya has identified agroforestry as a suitable intervention that enhances adaptation to adverse impacts of climate change while guaranteeing mitigation Co-benefits according to the National forests management and conservation policy (2015), National climate change framework policy 2015, the Kenya Agriculture sector growth and transformation strategy (2017-2027), Kenya framework for sustainable land management (2016-2026), Kenya climate smart Agriculture strategy (2017-2027) and the ongoing development of strategy for achieving and maintaining 10% tree cover by 2022. Successful adoption of agroforestry requires effective collaboration and partnership between a myriad range of sectoral actors, programs and strategies. However, there is no specific National strategic framework to facilitate building of partnerships and linkages amongst diverse initiatives and stakeholders involved in the promotion of agroforestry practices for purposes of minimizing negative impacts caused by a changing climate regime.
Kenya’s Nationally Determined Contribution  (NDC) is rooted in Kenya Vision 2030 – a roadmap of economic growth, social inclusion and sustainable development. Making progress towards achieving tree cover of at least 10% of the land area of Kenya is one of the mitigation activities to be promoted.

Uganda is highly sensitive to climate change and is already experiencing the impacts through increased frequency and intensity of disasters such as droughts, floods and landslides in recent years. Historic records show a decreasing trend in rainfall, but downscaled climate models predict a probable increase in precipitation during the short rainy season as well as a potential increase in extreme events. The Government has set an ambitious goal for its development, aiming to transform into a modern, middle-income country by 2040. The National Climate Change Policy (2015) is aimed at ensuring national development that is climate change resilient (Uganda National Development Plan 2015/16). Climate change mainstreaming has started with five priority sectors: agriculture, water, infrastructure, energy and lands. Understanding regional climate change impacts and assessing vulnerabilities across different sectors is crucial to effectively prepare for future risks imposed by climate change. Such an assessment enables practitioners and decision-makers to identify the most vulnerable areas, sectors and social groups and develop targeted interventions to mitigate the risk.

Globally, the number of motorized vehicles is estimated to reach between 2 and 3 billion vehicles by 2050 with a significant number located in developing countries like Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's motor vehicle fleet has been growing at a fast rate especially after the year 1990. The Zimbabwe Climate Change Response Strategy further identified that the nation's transport sector consumes over 1 billion liters of diesel and over 730 million liters of petrol annually. Part of the energy emissions come from the use of petroleum products in the transport sector.
Electric-Mobility is globally recognized as a viable and attractive option that can help the country redress the adverse issues faced with the conventional transportation system. In light of the significant contribution of the Zimbabwe transportation sector to the nation's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the adoption of eclectic mobility as a substitute for fossil fuel vehicles was noted to deliver significant cost-effective GHG reductions.

Mongolia is in the arid and semi-arid region; therefore, the amount of precipitation generally is low. The larger part of precipitation falls in the warm season and only below 3% of winter precipitation falls as snow. The spatial distribution of precipitation in Mongolia is very specific due to a vast area, land composition, roughness and geographical peculiarity.
Climate change studies show that a near-surface temperature and its annual mean over Mongolia have increased by 2.24° C between 1940-2016 periods. Climate change impacts on water resources have been visible; surface water resources have been declining over the years as numbers of lakes been dried out.
At the national level, Mongolia has adequate exploitable water resources to meet water demand up to 2030 as per current research. However, there are challenges at certain local levels:
Potential water shortages in dry months due to limited exploitable surface water resources caused by major seasonal disparities in rainfall patterns, as well as environmental flow requirements of 90-95% of the average surface water flow;

Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) are found to be competitive in various markets in coastal and island countries, globally. Amongst the various markets worldwide, the Pacific Island countries are expected to be most promising pertaining to the cost of oil-fired power, the demand for desalinated water, potential of aquaculture and the social benefits of this clean energy technology.  Furthermore, the enormous potential of ocean energy in Nauru is long known as the world’s first OTEC pilot plant was set up in Nauru by the Japanese Tokyo Electric Power company in 1981. It was the highest power OTEC plant ever operational and the first and last to feed power to an operating commercial grid. Due to extreme weather events, this OTEC plant is not operational anymore because of the damage made to the plant pipes.
Since the installation of the OTEC pilot plant in 1981, there have been significant improvements in OTEC technology and design, with side benefits such as the production of large amounts of fresh water. With the very rapid drop-off beyond the reef in Nauru, there is an opportunity for OTEC energy development in the country. Construction techniques have now also improved to become climate-proof. However, the Republic of Nauru lacks technical and financial resources as well as in-country expertise to conduct a pre-feasibility study and assess the potential of OTEC in comparison to other ocean energy possible solutions.
The main contribution of the Republic of Nauru to climate change mitigation is the implementation of its Energy Road Map (NERM) 2014-2020 in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve energy security by reducing reliance on imported fuel.
The specific targets of the NERM by 2020 are:
• 50% of grid electricity supplied from renewable energy sources;
• a 30% improvement in energy efficiency in the residential, commercial and government sectors.
In order to achieve these objectives, as the Republic of Nauru has limited land due to existing, intense phosphate mining, alternative renewable energy options (such as ocean energy) need to be assessed and mapped.

Context
The effects of climate change – recurring droughts, soil salinity and floods – are being felt keenly in the agricultural sector and preventing vulnerable population groups from achieving food security. Much of the equipment used in the sector is in a state of disrepair and little agricultural produce is processed.
Government measures and policies on economic and social development, especially in the rural sector, place a strong emphasis on training for youth and women in agriculture. Senegal’s first Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) also addresses the rural energy transition and the shift to renewables in refrigeration and food processing. In spite of these policies, achieving the food security and job creation targets assigned to this sector remains a challenge, in part due to a lack of access to appropriate, affordable and climate-resilient energy equipment.
The number of micro-businesses and small businesses is growing rapidly in Senegal, across both urban and rural areas. Most of these new businesses are involved in food processing. Processing (milling) of cereals (millet and maize) is a dominant activity practised by a large number of women, who produce a wide variety of products such as couscous, meal, grains and flour. However, these businesses struggle to access the technologies they need to reduce their carbon footprint and improve the quality of their products so they can sell them through more lucrative channels (supermarkets, exports).

Comparing the changes in average mean annual temperatures in Guatemala for the period 1971-2000 and the period 2001-2014, a rising trend in temperatures can be seen. Furthermore, the variability and extreme climatic events have had negative impacts on farming activities, the availability of water and soil degradation. Due to Guatemala’s dependence on rainfed agriculture, these phenomena have severe impacts on production in this sector and in the food security of the population. These impacts are more critical in areas such as the Dry Corridor, where a reduction in precipitation of up to 50 percent is forecast. In order to tackle this situation, the State has established a sound legislative and policy framework on climate change and is implementing various initiatives to reduce vulnerability to its effects.  
CTCN Support
To support the process of updating the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and other related planning frameworks, through collaboration in a Vulnerability Analysis (VA) in Guatemala’s expanded Dry Corridor, identification of actions for adaptation of the agriculture sector, livestock farming and food security, incorporation of the results of the analysis in the update of the NDC and preparation of two project ideas to support management of financing of the climate issue:

Development of implementation planning and communication documents;


Methodology for the formulation of an analysis of vulnerability to the effects of climate change on the Dry Corridor of Guatemala agreed with the key stakeholders;

Guatemala is ranked among the countries with the highest climate risk, given the impact that its territory has suffered from extreme meteorological events, which, associated with the socio-economic conditions of its population, have a high vulnerability to the effects of climate change. In this sense, the need arises to define public and government actions to reduce the effects/impacts of climate change, promoting in turn greater development and well-being of its population.
Guatemala has prioritized sectors for the definition and execution of climate actions, both to reduce the vulnerability and increase the resilience of populations and ecosystems to the impacts of climate change, and to mitigate GHG. Within the latter, the waste and industrial processes sectors have been prioritized. GHG emissions from the waste sector come mainly from the decomposition of organic matter in landfills, the incineration of waste, and the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater. On the other hand, in the industrial sector, GHGs come from the burning of fuels in furnaces, boilers and electricity generators, from industrial processes that contemplate the chemical or physical transformation of raw materials to metals, chemicals, or other minerals.
The Government of Guatemala has stated that one of the main limitations for the definition of specific climate actions is that there is no detailed information about the composition of waste generated in the municipalities.
CTCN Support
The update of the NDC of Guatemala implies the analysis of the successful mitigation technological options envisaged in the past, as well as new appropriate climate technologies for different sectors of the economy, including waste and industrial processes.
The technical assistance will be supporting the prioritized options specifically related to the reuse and recycling of the inorganic solid waste in the solid and liquid waste sector of the low emissions development strategy:
Analysis and selection of the municipality for the pilot project; review of development instruments; mapping of key actors and economic sectors with the greatest contribution to the emission of GHG;
Study of waste composition;
Definition of strategies for the integration of circular economy in municipal development processes (including agreements with the private sector and academia);
Validation of strategies with key stakeholders.
Expected impact
Identify vulnerable populations that depend on waste collection and present technology measures to improve the quality of life of these populations and their livelihoods. By improving waste management and integrating it into economic development processes, it contributes to the reduction of emissions and to social and economic well-being.

There is consensus on the central role that private-sector actors are able to play to support the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), as drivers of green growth, promoters of green supply chains, sources of investment in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, and as leaders of innovation in the development of clean technologies and the efficient use of resources.
During the last five years, efforts have been made in the Dominican Republic to promote greater private-sector participation in climate action. Under the terms of the Third National Communication, the private sector is participating in the implementation of actions to reduce GHG emissions. Despite these efforts, however, private-sector involvement remains weak. An analysis conducted in 2018 identified as barriers the lack of incentives for the private sector and academia, as well as the absence of enabling conditions (capacity, funding, robust institutions).

Owning to its wealth in natural resources, Zimbabwe’s economy is founded on sectors that are contributing to the current linear model, with key industries in the area of mining, steel, cement and agriculture. This has led the country to specialize in economic activities based on the extraction and partial processing of these resources, generating little economic benefit and significant environmental impacts, neglecting industrial activities that generate added value, and hindering industrial development based on technology and innovation. On the other hand, Zimbabwe generates up to 3 kg of waste per capita per day in urban areas which largely exceeds the global average.
Zimbabwe has implemented first public policies and private initiatives to advance towards an integrated waste management and a circular economy, characterized mainly by regulations, programs and initiatives that have established a framework for waste management, and promoted recycling to reduce the generation of waste and its recovery and reuse in order to protect the health of its citizens and the environment. However, there is the lack and asymmetry of information, as well as the coordination failures that exist in Zimbabwe with regard to the state and level of development of the circular economy, as well as the lack of knowledge of the players and the circular initiatives that are being developed in their respective territories, their potential benefits and existing barriers.
Zimbabwe requires a national strategy for a circular economy that collects and systematizes experiences, defines objectives and establishes clear goals, identifies and launches promising pilot projects, and provides information on the dimension of the existing benefits and barriers.

Paraguay is a landlocked developing country with a highly dependent economy on the primary sector, which makes it highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as temperature increase, pattern change in rainfall, and intensity and frequency increase of extreme weather events.
Technology is an important aspect to be taken into consideration in climate change both in strengthening mitigation and adaptation measures and in building resilience. The absence of a comprehensive Technological Needs Assessment (TNA) for the country increases the difficulties in determining the level and extent of support needed for implementation of the National Determined Contribution (NDCs) and other national development priorities, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). International cooperation is cited as an important prerequisite for leveraging of inputs for the implementations of the NDC. Among them is improving and adopting technologies for climate change mitigation and adaptation.
The country faces a lack of specialized skills required in climate technologies, innovations and knowledge. Other barriers include inadequate infrastructure services to ease the acquisition of appropriate technologies, lack of market awareness, lack of research and development of green technologies, inadequate incentives and enabling environment for technology transfer. Generally, these barriers affect the development and transfer of climate technologies in the country.

Jordan is one of four most water scarce countries in the world. This scarcity impacts every aspect of life within the country and is its greatest challenge to economic growth and development. Climate change is acting as a threat multiplier aggravating existing water vulnerability and availability due to decreased precipitation and higher rates of evaporation, as a result of increased temperature. It is also anticipated to increase the intensity of droughts in the country and the occurrence of flood events. 
The solid waste sector is a major contributor to GHG emissions and accounts for 12.5% of the total GHG emissions of the country. The sector has also been isolated as one of the main contaminators of Jordan’s scarce groundwater resources.
The current solid waste management system, with a network of landfill sites, dumpsites and transfer stations, has very few environmental controls.

Myanmar has substantial water resources; however, the resources are spatially and temporally unevenly distributed. Therefore, water‐related problems caused by different seasonal climate patterns vary depending on the geographic location. ‘Water resource management’ has been targeted as the main sector of concern for climate change adaptation in Myanmar. It was selected as the second priority level sector in the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA).
Rural Myanmar has been unable to access safe drinking water sufficiently. There are many rural communities in which safe drinking water cannot be provided based on their existing facilities. Considering increase in climate change impact, safe and reliable drinking water supply to rural communities has been prioritized as a crucial target for adaptation in Myanmar.
Water pumping system using a diesel engine has been used for irrigation and domestic water and drinking water supply to rural households in Myanmar. However, due to high diesel cost and limited facilities to generate electricity, rural residents have difficulties in use of such system adequately; therefore, they request alternative options for sustainable safe drinking water supply, in particular, to strengthen their climate resilience.

Sri Lanka is the fourth largest coconut producing country in the world with the average production of 2800 – 3000 million nuts. For the last two decades, coconut growers were facing many problems which ultimately encountered in the reduction of production and profitability of their plantations. The main factor that contributed to this reduction was the adverse effects caused by the prolong droughts as a result of climate change.
There are possible strategies introduced and recommended by Coconut Research Institute that can be adapted in coconut plantations. Soil and moisture conservation practices, cover cropping, intercropping, advance planting techniques and number of relevant technologies have introduced to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change.
Even though large number of technologies available and recommended by Coconut Research Institute of Sri Lanka, coconut growers in the area usually have little or incomplete knowledge on the potential technologies to address the problems.  Furthermore, even the technology and knowledge reach the coconut growers; they might not be utilized properly due to lack of background knowledge or financial difficulties. Therefore, more effort is needed for the dissemination of required technology and knowledge within Puttalam district than other traditional coconut growing areas.

Agriculture and animal husbandry are the leading sectors of the Cameroonian economy both in terms of assets and resources generated. Yet, Cameroon is one of the countries in the world where the production and consumption of milk per capita is the lowest. The Cameroonian livestock is estimated at 12 million head for a production of 125 000 tons of milk. Most of the dairy animals are raised extensively. Milk is only collected to a limited extent. Thus, it is estimated that actual milk production represents only 45% of potential production. The processing and distribution sector is still in its infancy, although dynamic.  In the Far North region, milk is one of the staple foods for the population.
The Far North of Cameroon is a very different region from the rest of the country: it presents a significant similarity with the other countries of the Sahel. It is the arid zone that for years has been in the international headlines due to conflicts, terrorism, drought and hunger. The Sahel is also one of the most environmentally degraded regions in the world. It is undoubtedly one of the most vulnerable parts of climate change, with temperature increases expected to be 1.5 times higher than the global average.

Context
In the Republic of Congo, the electricity distribution network does not serve remote towns, those with low population density, and where industrial activities are non-existent. The electrification of localities not yet connected to the main electricity grid is especially done through the installation of diesel generators. This fortuitous option is too expensive for rural populations, because of the use and transport of fuel in these localities, which are often difficult to access, but also because of the operation and maintenance of the same installations. Generating sets are also a principal source of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming.
In recent years, the country has been engaged in the construction of hydroelectric dams, which are installed close to major urban centres and industrial zones. Unfortunately, small communities are still deprived of this service and continue to use generators. In line with the implementation of the rural electrification policy, with clean energy and aware of the fact that Congo benefits from a dense hydrographic network, an end-of-training engineer's thesis on the electrification of a locality in southern Congo, carried out by a student of the Ecole Nationale Supérieure Polytechnique (ENSP) of the University of Brazzaville, evaluated the energy demand at about 338,679 kW. Thus, anticipating parameters such as natural population growth, it is envisaged that energy needs will increase, hence the opportunity to explore the possibility of withdrawing the use of generators, a source of GHG emissions, and replacing them with hydroelectric installations. It is in this perspective that the Government of the Republic of Congo has addressed a request for technical assistance to the CTCN, with a view to creating a pilot site to be duplicated in other localities of the country. The main objective of the project is to identify a suitable technology and equipment for the production of hydropower via a tidal turbine system for the electrification of a small locality in Kibossi as a pilot site.

Botswana’s Vision 2036 sets a target of 50% renewable electricity on the system by 2036. In the longer-term, it is anticipated that renewable energy will make a significant contribution to the Botswana’s greenhouse gas emissions targets, which, under the UNFCCC, is currently set at 15% reduction relative to business as usual by 2030. This focus on sustainable energy sources has resulted in the urgent need for the Government to update its Technology Need Assessment (TNA), a document published in November 2004. Botswana’s NAMA (2016) cites a number of barriers aimed at explaining the lack of progress in implementing Botswana’s TNA (2004), including the lack of an enabling and conducive environment for operations of the mitigation projections, the high and long term investment nature of the projects, existing subsidies on substitutes of climate mitigation projects and the lack of trained personnel to develop climate change proposal.

Among the total energy consumption of the Kyrgyz Republic, the building sector comprises more than seventy percent. The analysis on creating an inventory for the public buildings was conducted in May 2018 to identify its energy saving potential with energy efficient measures and garner global investment opportunities in the sector. The study reported 9,780 public buildings consume 850 GWh/year, which is 10% of total energy consumption with annually increasing rates.
Most of the public buildings in the Kyrgyz Republic were outdated, built around 35-75 years ago during the Soviet period, and had no retrofits thus far leaving them with high normative energy demand - of approximately 250 kWh per m2 - and poor insulation - 70-88% of energy used for space heating. In the winter season, in particular, there are frequent outages in public buildings. These severely under-heated buildings result in poor public service delivery in schools, hospitals and community sectors.
In order to institutionalize and standardize the energy performance of buildings nationwide, it is important to lift up the level of the ‘building codes’ comparable to international standards.

Botswana's energy capacity is thermal, mainly coal-fired, with some small diesel generators in rural areas. The bulk of domestic electricity production is generated by the Morupule coal-fired station; 20% is thermal while only 0,1% was from solar energy in 2016. Botswana has no hydro-electric power resources.
In Botswana, 66% of the population have access to electricity. The high level of electrification of Botswana’s households presents significant opportunities for ensuring that new uses of electricity are of the highest level of energy efficiency. Thus, while challenges remain associated with income levels and rural electrification, encouraging adoption of more energy efficient equipment and products amongst users is an important policy opportunity. Mitigating the potential for growth in demand will also help the country achieve its energy diversification goals while limiting the need for importing electricity to meet peak power demand. Due to other competing highly prioritized agendas such as electrification, food, water, housing and other more pressing, energy efficiency is not seen as a primary priority in Botswana. Botswana electric charges are subsidised by the government, which result in longer payback periods for energy savings projects or energy efficient technologies than if full utility costs were charged. This negatively impacts the sales of higher efficiency units, compared to their cheaper but less efficient competitors.
Like several other countries in the region, Botswana has an energy policy in draft, but this is at a very broad level, does not address any technologies, does not have any specific regulations and provides no enforcement mandate. Despite the limitations noted, including low population density and low incomes, Botswana has much to gain by adopting energy efficient standards and technologies.

The 15 fastest growing cities in the world - according to United Nations population estimates - are all in Africa. According to a UN Habitat report, the phenomenon of accelerated urbanization is one of the major causes of environmental degradation and its most visible consequence is undoubtedly deforestation. Burkina Faso is experiencing strong population growth. The population could reach 25 million by 2025, 9 million of whom will live in urban areas. Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso are already home to 62% of the country's urban population and the urbanization rate could rise from 20.3 in 2006 to 35% in 2026.
Faced with the inevitable impacts of climate change, it appears necessary to adapt urban centers in order to reduce the vulnerability of territories and populations to various natural disasters such as droughts, landslides, famine and floods. Urban greening and urban green Infrastructure are actions that are regularly put forward in terms of adaptation to climate factors, for example to combat the aggravation of the urban heat island phenomenon or the significant variability of rainfall.
Burkina Faso's main urban centers have a large amount of land for the creation of green spaces provided for in the cadastral plans. However, green space sites are illegally occupied (27% in 2012), diverted from their initial use or colonized by socio-economic infrastructures such as schools, places of worship and commercial kiosks. In the face of these threats, protection, beautification and enhancement is a major challenge for sustainable management of landscaping in Burkina Faso in order to improve the quality of life of the population in urban areas as reflected in the National Landscaping Strategy.

Tunisia is in one of the world’s most water-scarce and dry regions. The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for Tunisia indicates that its economy, the population, and ecosystems are highly vulnerable to climate change. The country is expected to see shrinking of agricultural land areas due to increasing water scarcity. The reduction of agricultural GDP as a result of declining yields is estimated at about 5 to 10% by as early as 2030.
Drinking water is a scarce and expensive resource in Tunisia and the pressure on already scarce resource are increasing. Considering the climate change, population increase and the demand for water, Tunisia is searching for long-term solutions to address water scarcity, such as installation of desalination plants, water transfer, dams and other solutions. Many of the available options are highly energy-intensive thus causing high operational costs.
Tunisia has made water resources management and access to water for the population a national priority. Implementation of smart water networks is one way of supporting this national priority and is a core activity of this readiness proposal. The implementation of the proposed smart water network will on a long term horizon improve the management of the water resources in the whole of Tunisia, and on a shorter term in the Sahel district of Tunisia, which will be the target area of the activities of this project.

Despite this heavy dependence on agriculture, only 14% of the country's land is considered suitable for agriculture, making sustainable land management a major challenge.
The overall objective of this technical assistance is to promote wider use of agrometeorological services to improve data availability, climate forecasting, early warning, adaptation planning and decision making in the agricultural sector. In the medium and long term, this project aims to reduce climate risks in agricultural production, thereby improving food supply and livelihood security.

Côte d'Ivoire faces critical environmental issues with recurrent floods and droughts as well as air pollution, particularly in urban areas. Abidjan, the economic capital of Côte d'Ivoire, is the most populous city with 4,707,000 inhabitants, or 21% of the country's total population, and is experiencing rapid urban growth characterized by heavy industrialization and urbanization. Cocody, a district of Abidjan with a lagoon frontage of 57 km, is subject to significant pressure due to rapid urbanization. Cocody is also known to have the largest number of people affected by flooding.
The Municipal Council of the Commune of Cocody decided in 2017 to initiate and implement a vast project that aims to make from the Commune of Cocody, a leading and model of a smart city.  A central element of this project is the greening of urban spaces and the planting of mangroves in the coastal area.

Low carbon Transport is both a mitigation and an adaptation challenge for the people of Solomon Islands. The transport sector needs to reduce its carbon footprint and be resilient to the effects of fluctuating and expensive fossil fuels. The high reliance on imported expensive petroleum products for the transport sector continues to pose a serious climate change concern and an economic challenge for the small and fragile economy of the Solomon Islands. The reliance on fossil fuel for transportation goes against the country’s climate change mitigation ambition as reflected in the NDC, the Climate Change policy, its National Energy Policy and Strategic Plan and its National Development Strategy.
While there might be information available on the transportation system in Solomon Islands, the information is fragmented with unclear institutional frameworks in place. The existence of information asymmetry in the transportation institutional structure of Solomon Islands creates policy and regulatory challenges for low carbon transport developments.
The lack of education and awareness on the importation and use of low emission vehicles is a barrier to the rapid uptake of energy efficient vehicles into the county.
CTCN Support
Identify the policy, legislative and regulatory barriers to low carbon transport;
Identify the technical, financial, institutional and capacity barriers to low carbon transport;

Only 27.4% of the total population in Mozambique have access to electricity. This figure drops down sharply in rural areas where the access to electricity is only about 3%. The government of Mozambique is putting large efforts to expand the electricity network. While Mozambique has significant generation potential, the distribution of power to Mozambique’s population is extremely expensive due to the large size of the country and its dispersed settlement patterns. Due to poor connectivity and inadequate transmission network within the country, part of Mozambique exports power to Eskom (in South Africa), which in turn sells the power back to southern Mozambique at an increased rate and incurring high technical, financial and national security implications. Low efficient appliances and electricity-using equipment result in huge losses, which bring a heavy burden on the government’s budget (electricity is subsidized) and hampers the country’s electrification potential. The lack of information and awareness, lack of dedicated policies for energy efficient products and appliances including absence of minimum energy performance standards prevents Mozambique from inducing a sustainable market transformation in favor of higher efficiency products.
CTCN Support
Develop a technology roadmap and action plan for promoting and adoption of efficient appliance;
Propose draft minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and labeling for energy efficient appliances and refrigerators;

Sierra Leone has been ranked as the most vulnerable nation after Bangladesh and Guinea Bissau to adverse effects of climate change. The population is highly vulnerable to climate change and due to high reliance to rain fed agriculture and natural resources-based livelihoods which are hard hit by the result of the associated global temperature increase. This is despite that the country's greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are negligible. Thus, the country needs to plan accordingly and integrate climate change planning across its sectors.
The country’s NDC aims to transition to low emissions development involving decoupling carbon emissions from economic growth through a series of measures across all economic sectors. The main sector of focus includes the energy sector where the strategies include ensuring a fair, equitable, sustainable supply and distribution of electricity for development.

A low percentage of Burundi’s population has access to grid electricity, particularly in rural settings. Only one in ten Burundians have access to electricity in the country and this drops to only 2% in rural areas. Burundi’s national energy production is lower than consumption, hence the increasing need to import energy. Thus, there is a need to increase national electricity production. Energy resources that are used currently are either costly, or pose threats to the environment, such as the use of firewood. Burundi has set a goal of diversifying its primary energy mix to take advantage of favorable indigenous renewable energy resources. One of the key sources of diversification will be electricity generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies, which will help to reduce carbon emissions and dependency on imported fuel, address adaptive capacity to climate change, improve energy access, and increase national generating capacity. Solar energy is available and well distributed across Burundi.
Burundi has already embarked on a nationwide solar PV-based rural electrification program. However, the program is beset by several difficulties, largely related to a shortage of trained technicians capable of properly installing and maintaining solar PV systems. As a result, installed solar PV facilities are often out of order or not performing according to their designed output, which contributed to creating negative perception of solar PV as an energy solution.
CTCN Support
Develop off-gird solar PV training materials;
Train and build the capacity of the various stakeholders in the installation, use, operations and maintenance, and deployment of solar PV technologies in Burundi;

A major part of Mongolia’s land is degraded through overgrazing, deforestation, and climate change. Climate change has significant impacts on Mongolia’s grassland ecosystems and the livestock farming which consequently threatens the food security of the country. In the entire value chain of livestock sector, the nomadic livestock herders are most vulnerable as they are directly facing the adverse impacts of climate change on the animals, pasture lands and of the ensuing scarcity of water and grazing for animals. Due to loss of the livestick to erratic weather events and climate disasters (e.g., dzud), the herders are increasing the livestock headcount, in turn leading to overgrazing of pastures. The pastures are lacking nutrition, and thus gaining weight during warm seasons is difficult.
With the existing players in the market, the value-adding process like meat production, processing, packaging and selling are several steps away from these communities. Hence, communities are also suffering as their livelihood is depleting, making them more vulnerable to the climate change. Lack of institutional capacity, barriers to the market and lack of adequate risk mitigation measures and financing are further adding to it.
CTCN Support

Cambodia is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change and has difficulties in implementing the country’s climate change response due to a lack of available quality-assured information and knowledge on climate change in the country. Significant gaps still remain in creating the conditions for science-based climate-informed decision making, in particular related to the production, access and use of climate information at local levels.
As highlighted in its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), Cambodia’s vulnerability is characterised by frequent floods and irregular rainfall, coupled with an agrarian-based economy, limited human and financial resources, insufficient physical infrastructure, and limited access to technologies.
The lack of adaptive capacity and the ability to define and implement adaptation strategies, in particular at the local level, is further hindered by significant gaps in information. According to the mid-term review (2019) of the Cambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan (2014-2023) which has been guiding both adaptation and mitigation efforts in the country, substantial gaps in the production and use of relevant data at different scales need to be addressed to improve (local) decision making process on adaptation. Though a number of climate change projects have been implemented or are under preparation, significant gaps still need to be addressed.
CTCN Support
To design a web-based local climate information system and establish an associated baseline (including related management protocols), which can support adaptation decision making processes, and provide services for climate information delivery at the sub-national (local) level.

Water shortage is one of the most pressing issues that Pakistan currently faces. The country has the world's fourth highest rate of water use, and its water intensity rate, which is the amount of water used per unit of GDP, is the world's highest. Existing water resources in Pakistan are stressed due to rapidly growing population size, urbanization and subsequent unplanned land use changes. Water resources are inextricably linked with climate, and projected climate change has serious implications for Pakistan’s water resources and especially vulernable populations, agriculture, ecology, and local biodiversity. Freshwater resources in Pakistan rely on snow and glacier-melt and monsoon rains, both highly sensitive to climate change.
Pakistan has the world’s largest indigenous rainwater harvesting (runoff collection) system, known as the spate irrigation system, which diverts flood water through natural weir-regulated structures and irrigates roughly 0.3 million hectare of cultivated land. In some areas, the spate irrigation system is technically advanced. However, even though this technique is long practiced by several communities, it is often lacking in quality and sustainability. Most community-owned storm water harvesting ponds are poorly designed and vulnerable to contamination. 
Rainwater harvesting for artificial groundwater recharge and flood control in urban areas uses a technique that involves the construction of an inverted well that channels flood water to help recharge groundwater, while also stopping urban flooding. This technique offers both an opportunity for urban flood management and increased drought resilience in areas dependent upon rainwater.
CTCN Support

Burundi is the 14th most vulnerable country and is the 17th least ready country–meaning that it is extremely vulnerable to, yet very unready to combat climate change effects. Climate adaptation requires changes in behavior and appropriate technologies and measures to increase the resilience to floods and drought and provide protection to the main sectors such as agriculture, (critical) infrastructure, people and the environment where the risk of storm surge and flooding is imminent.
The population of Burundi belongs to the poorest segment in the region and does not have the capacity and the means to invest in infrastructural improvements for flood prevention, such as concrete dams. Nor do they have the capacity to respond adequately to flooding emergencies by constructing bridges in flooded areas. Within Burundi there is a lack of creation, sharing or appropriate use of data, information and knowledge for climate adaptation. Institutional and organisational barriers lead to unclear and unestablished roles and responsibilities when it comes to climate adaptation. Furthermore, agriculture, buildings and roads are not developed to be flood resilient. The (local) government does not have the capacity and resources to address the problems. The environmental degradation and the propensity for flooding in various areas have exacerbated the flooding situation.

Select and implement a low-cost, climate resilient, re-usable, easy replicable, scalable and mobile flood barrier to prevent damage from flooding and ensure water availability in times of drought in one pilot site of Rubira Hills, Musenyi area of Mpanda Commune in Bubanza, Burundi.
Expected Results
This project will empower Burundi to effectively adapt to climate change. The mobile flood barrier should enable effective flood prevention and water storage to ensure water availability in times of drought. The mobile flood barrier will be used to prevent damage to agriculture, infrastructure, the people and the environment caused by flooding. Water control will also contribute to an increase in agriculture production and therewith food security. By implementing the selected technology, institutions should be enforced to establish governance structures aimed at enhancing resilience against climate change in the form of floods and droughts. The implementation of the technology should also lead to better use of weather forecasting data.

The geographical location of Honduras between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans exposes it to numerous and diverse natural hazards and extreme weather events. The impacts of climate change vary across the country: in the Caribbean, cyclones are more common, while in the center and south drought is more prevalent, along with the recurrent effects of the El Niño and La Niña phenomenon. Due to the topography, landslides are also quite common.
Honduras is the second largest country in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 68% of the population lives in conditions of poverty or extreme poverty. This population is also the most affected by natural disasters. Hurricanes Eta and Iota devastated the country in 2020, leaving more than a hundred people dead, 3.5 million people affected and displaced, and thousands of hectares of crops destroyed.

Liberia is a small West African state with borders in the north with the republic of Guinea, in east with Ivory Coast, in the west, with Sierra Leone and in the south with the Atlantic Ocean. Agriculture is a major sector of Liberia employing more than 70% of the population. However, Liberia agriculture system is rain-fed, indicating heavy dependence on rainfall. Climate change has posed serious challenge on all sectors and has adversely threatened sustainable agricultural production in Liberia.
Besides, the historical climate change scenarios include increased average annual temperatures of 0.8°C throughout the country, a 15.7% increase of hot nights which lead to decline in mean annual rainfall. All of these are happening when Liberia is yet to recover from the 14 unbroken years of civil conflict that ruin major agricultural infrastructures ranging from farm electricity, mails for rice production in the targeted agro-ecological zones and coupled with the global recession, Ebola and now COVID-19. Prior to the war, there were estimates about the irrigation potentials of the country (FAO, 2004). Today, there is little or no information about full or partial control irrigation; surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, localized irrigation, percent of area irrigated from groundwater and percent of area irrigated from surface water in Liberia.

Papua New Guinea’s economic development will require considerable growth in the coverage and quality of its state transport network. The total road network is 30 000 kilometers, of which 8460 km are state roads. Only 28% of the 8460 km of state roads were in a good condition as noted in 2010. A comprehensive program of rehabilitating existing roads and constructing new roads would expand the state road network to 25 000 km by 2035.
 It is expected that with the expansion of state road network and urbanization, the use of land transport will increase substantially resulting in the increased number of vehicles on road. The number of vehicles is expected to increase from approximately 155,000 in 2005 to more than 600,000 in 2030. It is also estimated that the demand for transportation fuel which is fossil fuel-based in PNG could increase by a factor of three or four, resulting in emissions increasing from 1.6–2.4 to 3.3–4.5 Mt CO2e by 2030.
Besides, GHG emissions from the land transport sector will result into congestions on road and adverse impacts on health due to tailpipe emissions. Moreover, the land transport infrastructure will be vulnerable to the rising sea levels and coastal flooding, increased rainfall intensity, frequency and inland flooding.
The rapid development of electric and hybrid vehicle technology at a global level offers an opportunity to PNG to deploy electric vehicles. With the target of increasing the share of renewable energy as the source of electricity under NDC of PNG, the deployment of electric vehicles is promising. The deployment of electric vehicles would result in a substantial drop in oil consumption and offer a reduction of 22% in emissions in 2035.

Vanuatu has set ambitious targets of reaching 100% renewable energy for electricity production by 2030, requiring 15% energy savings through energy efficiency measures. However, progress towards achieving such measures requires effective policies, relevant legislation, information-based planning, and private sector participation, amongst others, to facilitate activities towards meeting the national energy targets.
The urban household appliance and energy use survey in 2013 indicated that many appliances currently used in households, including refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and lighting products are outdated and highly inefficient. Therefore, Vanuatu has introduced legislations on labelling and standards for appliances with the assistance of the Pacific Community (SPC) Pacific Appliance and Labelling Standards (PALS) Project (2012 – June 2019). The labelling and standards regulations were adopted in 2017 and has since been implemented and enforced. However, the impact of the programme to the nation has not been quantified, and the effectiveness has been undermined by a missing monitoring, evaluation and enforcement plan, as well as missing financial schemes to incentivize the uptake in households.
CTCN Support
Conduct a technical market and policy assessment in order to identify challenges and bottlenecks to the effectiveness of the standards and labelling programme, and support the introduction of a comprehensive monitoring, evaluation and enforcement plan as well as of targeted financial mechanisms to accelerate the uptake of energy efficient appliances in Vanuatu.
Expected Results
This technical assistance will contribute to the transition to energy efficient appliances (household refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners and lighting products) by making the current standards and labelling programme for appliances more efficient. Vanuatu will be able to increase the enforcement of and compliance with standards and labelling legislations. The identified financing mechanisms will accelerate the purchase of energy efficient appliances through incentivization of consumers.",,,,

Panama is a narrow strip of land, bordering two major oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic, with a coastline of more than 2400 km. This coastal zone is one of the most diverse in the region, with a wide variety of ecosystems such as mangrove forests, estuaries, reefs, archipelagos, etc. These natural environments provide a series of ecosystem services that have an impact on activities such as fishing and tourism, sustaining the economy of many communities. The direct impacts of sea level rise such as coastal erosion, saline intrusion and coastal flooding have become worrying threats to these communities. In addition to this, the majority of the population living in coastal areas are mostly classified as extremely poor, placing them in a double inequality, where socio-economic factors aggravate their vulnerability to climate change.
Considering the available sea level rise scenarios, it is important to have high resolution local marine dynamics data. Meteorological-oceanic variables are essential to characterize the vulnerability of coastal communities, infrastructure, and activities to possible flooding. In this sense, and with the CTCN assistance, the aim is to obtain a high-resolution database on marine dynamics (mean sea level, waves, meteorological tide, astronomical tide).
The development of these marine dynamic’s indicators will allow Panama to have the necessary inputs to characterize coastal flooding in the face of extreme events and climate change, and thus be able to direct adaptation efforts and direct resources to those regions and activities that are threatened by coastal disaster events.
CTCN Support
The overall objective of this technical assistance is to develop key tools for risk assessment in Panamanian coasts in order to implement climate change adaptation in coastal-marine zones:
Development of high-resolution numerical data of marine dynamics (Coastal Flood Elevation Points on: (meteorological tide + astronomical tide + waves and projections of mean sea level rise) at a resolution of less than 30 km for the Panamanian Atlantic and Pacific coasts in different return periods (10, 15, 50 and 100) and under different emission scenarios.
Methodological tools (procedural guides) for the generation of marine dynamics data and their use in coastal risk assessment.
Assessment and recommendation of adaptation measures for the coastal zone with nature-based solutions.
Technical capacity building through training of officials of the Climate Change Directorate of the Ministry of the Environment
Development of high impact graphic material for communities at risk.
Expected Results
The main activity of this assistance is the development of high-resolution numerical databases on marine dynamics. Also, this technical assistance will ensure the elaboration of procedural tools for coastal risk assessment based on the data generated, recommendations for nature-based adaptation measures for the coast (nature-based solutions), capacity transfer to the Climate Change Directorate of the Ministry of Environment, and the realization of high impact graphic material on the communities at risk previously identified.

There is a consensus of the growing problem with street and roadside vendors in The Bahamas. Vendors are selling their goods without the necessary permits and breaching Covid-19 orders. The government of The Bahamas is taking steps to bring street vendors into the formal economy, with the development of enabling policies and fostering agriculture production. Currently, 90% of the food is imported in The Bahamas and there is an urgent need to become more self-sufficient.
The overall objective of the technical assistance is to build resilience in the agricultural sector to improve food distribution, and to an extent, improve food security.

The City of Mbombela has been impacted by climate change and drought in particular, which affects tree growth, threatens species and degrades habitat. These impacts have necessitated the planting of drought-resistant trees. The city began planting trees in rural townships in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Forestry & Fisheries, and have involved community members in this work, which also contributes to carbon storage and sequestration efforts. The city has developed an alien species control plan, which works in tandem with tree planting to enable the removal of unwanted vegetation in order to conserve water resources while also contributing to biodiversity. A wetlands inventory also guides this work, as it identifies important wetland areas to preserve for the purposes of disaster risk reduction, climate resilience, water resource management, and biodiversity maintenance.
The municipality is required, according to its Climate Change Strategy, to implement climate actions that contribute to the country’s mitigation commitments. However, since the trees are not monitored, the reports are based on assumptions and often inaccurate. Technology is lacking to monitor tree growth and health, and therefore the city has not been able to track progress over time. 
CTCN Support
The city requires assistance in developing a GIS-based tree monitoring system or tool to monitor tree growth over time and to quantify carbon sequestration. This would accompany the planting of trees in rural areas, housing projects, along streets and in parks. The city is also requesting support in establishing municipal nurseries to supply trees. 
Expected Impact
This type of system would facilitate tree planting and give the city the ability to monitor trees and track growth, tree health and carbon storage over time. Most households and food gardens are owned and managed by women, who would therefore be direct beneficiaries of the program since they are paid stipends to plant trees. There are a multitude of cross-cutting benefits to biodiversity, livelihoods and food provision from additional fruit trees. The city would also benefit culturally from the sharing of indigenous knowledge with the project team on tree species types and observations regarding ecological and tree species changes over the years.",,,"Zero hunger, Good health and well-being, Gender equality, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action",

South Africa is facing serious electricity supply capacity challenges. Eskom, the largest producer of electricity in South Africa, has resorted to load shedding in order to reduce peak loads, which has resulted in disruptions to businesses and the public. About 90% of electricity supplied in South Africa is produced from coal, rendering coal power plants responsible for around 80% of total emissions in the country. The government approved an Integrated Resource Plan in 2019, detailing the procurement of renewable energy sources up to 2030. According to this resource plan, renewable energy will comprise 37% of the power to be generated by 2030, with wind and solar power among the largest contributors. However, electricity generation from these sources is variable. In order to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid, Eskom and the municipalities need to address the potential load shape challenges while confronting other ongoing challenges such as costly transmission and distribution upgrades, the retirement of old power plants, and the need to design for resilience in the wake of climate change and natural disasters. Demand Response (DR) is becoming an important resource to meet energy demand and flexibility in power systems because it has the potential to reduce peak demand and provide the flexibility for the integration of a high proportion of renewable energy into the power system. Therefore, the current DR programs need to be expanded beyond energy intensive users to include residential and small to medium size industrial and commercial customers. The uptake of the established DR programs thus far has been low.
The barriers to its wider adoption and deployment are not only technological but regulatory. It is important to ensure that electricity consumers understand what DR is, and how they can participate in and benefit from its deployment. An effective communication infrastructure is also necessary to provide connectivity to different energy systems, devices and applications. Standardization is needed, as flexibility cannot be identified and exploited without it, and since this may also be a barrier if investors are concerned about becoming “locked‐in” to a particular supplier, which may result in future sub-optimal decision-making. 
A study is required to assess the operational feasibility, as well as costs and benefits to assess the feasibility of actual DR implementation within the South African grid balancing system. 
CTCN Support
CTCN will provide technical assistance to start the program and build capacity by working with international technical experts. This will include the following:
High‐level economic assessment of demand for DR services from a systems perspective;
DR potential assessment across South Africa;
Assessment of the potential value creation of DR;
Identification of the technology requirements for actual implementation;
Recommendations to resolve regulatory challenges; and
Capacity building and training of the research team. 
Expected Impact
The wider adaptation and implementation of DR in the South African market can have a positive impact on the whole population, including the residential sector, enabling the democratization of the energy sector through the participation of individual households in the electricity market and the ultimate lowering of energy costs. ",,,"Affordable and clean energy",

Water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges in Maldives arising from climate change. Freshwater is the most important water resource in the country; however, it’s quality and quantity are highly affected by climate variations and human activities such as urbanisation of the country and water use for agriculture. Moreover, intrusion of saline water deteriorates the quality of freshwater resources. Existing poor agricultural practices, such as use of dug wells as fertiliser mixing containers which causes leaching of fertilisers into freshwater resources, further intensifies this problem. Depletion of freshwater resources due to uncontrolled usage in the absence of appropriate means to regulate results in the threats to groundwater aquifers on the islands of Maldives.
Excessive groundwater extraction has led to saline water intrusion and reduction of the efficiency of its natural recharge processes. In particular, during drought season, over-pumping can alter the size of the groundwater aquifer and limit recovery to its former size. Therefore, it is vital to develop and deploy an efficient method for groundwater extraction in order to ensure sustainable use of limited water resources with minimum impact on the aquifers in Maldives.
CTCN Support
Design and installation of an infiltration gallery system for groundwater extraction to ensure sustainable use of limited water resources with minimum impact on the aquifers in HDh.Nolhivaranfaru Island.
Expected Results
Through this project, a sustainable groundwater extraction system for agricultural practices will be established, and unpolluted groundwater aquifers will be protected in HDh.Nolhivaranfaru Island.
Findings from the technical assistance would support the country to promote sustainable groundwater extraction and management for agricultural practices in HDh.Nolhivaranfaru Island. In particular, by establishing and operating the infiltration gallery system, it is expected that unpolluted groundwater aquifers would be protected in the island. Moreover, the capacity and knowledge of farming communities in the island and agriculture-related stakeholders on sustainable agricultural practices and water use efficiency for agriculture would be strengthened. Based on findings from the project, it is also expected that point groundwater extraction methods currently used in other islands could be replaced with the proposed infiltration gallery system, which would contribute to increasing the capacity of climate resilience with sustainable water supply for agriculture in Maldives.",,,,

Nigeria is the largest economy in sub-Saharan Africa, but power sector limitations are constraining further economic development. Being endowed with large oil, gas, hydro and solar resources, the government has the potential to generate more than 12,500 MW of electric power from existing plants, but on most days it is only able to generate around 4,000 MW due to the unavailability of gas, breakdowns, water shortage and grid constraints that result in frequent electricity outages. The average Nigerian firm claims outage related losses equivalent to more than 4% of sales. According to the World Bank’s projection, electricity demand is expected to grow by a factor of 5 until 2035, to almost 530 TWh, which will exacerbate the existing challenges. 
The government has therefore prioritized energy generation, transmission and consumption efficiency as key actions in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), as there is a need to formulate and implement energy efficiency programs in various sectors to reduce power shortage and also increase the competitiveness of the industrial sector by reducing energy intensity per unit product. Nationally coordinated energy efficiency measures are not yet in place, although several policies exist, and research has been conducted on energy conservation and efficiency, the promotion of energy efficient appliances and light bulbs, and on improved cookstove performance. 
Energy efficiency is important in addressing energy insecurity and meeting present and future energy demands. However, the overarching barrier that must be overcome is the complexity of introducing energy sector reforms across industry, commerce and transport, where activities are highly fragmented.
CTCN Support
The objective is to develop a harmonized framework of regulations that instigate adoption and  implementation of energy efficient technologies and practices in the industrial, commercial and transport sectors. The technical assistance will also support the development of an institutional structure to monitor and report on activities undertaken toward compliance with the regulations.
Anticipated activities include:
Review and analysis of existing energy consumption data, identification of existing regulations and policies that regulate energy use, and the development of a framework for the Energy Efficiency Act (EEA) and regulations;
Development of a methodology to help identify and classify the industrial and household sectors and sub-sectors under the purview of the framework;
Development of the EEA framework, including a curriculum and training modules for energy auditors and managers; and
Proposal for an institutional structure for monitoring and reporting. 
Expected Impact
The developed harmonized framework of regulations will facilitate the adoption and implementation of energy efficient technologies and practices in the industrial and household sectors, bolstered by a monitoring and evaluation framework to track compliance.
This project will contribute to the achievement of Nigeria’s NDC, which prioritizes an economy-wide energy efficiency as a key mitigation measure, with a potential GHG reduction of 179 million tonnes per year in 2030. Nigeria has specifically targeted energy efficiency to reduce overall energy demand and increase the efficiency of existing vehicles and the transport system. 
The process to develop the framework will consider the role of gender in all decision-making and ensure equitable consultation and representation in the process.

In recent years, Vietnam has accumulated an increased amount of municipal solid waste (MSW) due to rapid growth of the population and economy. The country has recognized the waste management sector as one of the key areas for climate change mitigation measures. Conventional waste treatment practices such as open dumping into landfill sites is one of Vietnam’s major GHG emissions sources due to its generation of methane. Its NDC includes a target to “Utilize landfill gas and solid waste combustion for power generation.”
In order to reach its goals, Vietnam seeks to introduce and deploy Waste to Energy (WtE) with a waste incineration process to decrease the volume of waste delivered to landfill sites, and  thermal recycling technology to supply energy such as electricity. WtE provides multiple benefits such as GHG emissions reductions, prolonged lifetime of final waste disposal sites, reduced odor and insect problems near landfill sites, and energy security. However, WtE technology has not been deployed widely due to a lack of technology evaluation capacity, expertise and experience.

The Kingdom of Eswatini is a landlocked country facing numerous challenges including poverty, food insecurity, and vulnerability to climate-related disasters. The economy of Eswatini is largely agro-based, making it even more vulnerable to climate change. Livestock and crop production under rain-fed conditions have declined by over 30% on average over the last few farming seasons due to changes in rainfall patterns and increasing frequency of droughts. The government has identified sugarcane as a strategic crop that can be utilized to alleviate poverty, especially in the poverty-stricken areas of the Lowveld, with the necessary technical support to create viable businesses. However, the sugar production sector is most at risk from climate induced changes. 
Eswatini’s total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been steadily rising since 1990 primarily driven by increasing emissions from the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sector, which comprised 48% of total emissions in 2018. To reduce the sugar sector’s contribution to the country’s emissions, a shift to solar energy has been prioritised by the Eswatini Sugar Association. 
In an effort to reduce climate vulnerability and empower farmers with economically viable livelihoods that build upon an existing successful commercial sugarcane production agribusiness, the government of Eswatini established the Eswatini Water and Agricultural Development Enterprise (ESWADE) in 1999 to facilitate the planning and implementation of farmer owned and managed sugarcane farms. Since 1999, the Government through ESWADE has developed two major smallholder irrigation projects in the country, and since then, several other small-scale growers have been established. The vast majority of the farmer owned sugarcane companies are connected to the national electricity grid. The electricity requirement for cane farming is focused on pumping water to cane fields through pressurised irrigation systems such as centre pivots, sprinklers and drip. However, irrigation is the major water user in Eswatini as it takes up to 96% of total water consumption, and all sugarcane is irrigated due to a lack of sufficient rain in the cane growing areas. Combined with the increasing GHG emissions tied to grid electricity purchased from South Africa’s electricity generator, ESKOM, the energy costs of cane farmers are averaging over 24% of total operational costs and rising steadily. 
According to the Sustainable Energy for All Country Action Plan (2014), there are untapped market opportunities (valued USD 13m in the sugarcane sector alone) for renewable energy investments. The majority of cane farmers are looking for alternatives in the form of renewable energy to remain competitive while reducing their carbon footprint. However, they face economic barriers to investment in new energy technologies, including purchasing costs and obtaining local solar system designers and suppliers. Most farmers cannot directly invest in renewable energy as they cannot meet debt-equity requirements of banks and also lack the institutional capacity to implement large-scale solarisation of farms. There has also been limited awareness about the advantages of solar power across the cane farming communities, though this is changing.  
The government would like to increase the coverage of solar PV as an alternative source of energy for irrigation systems while reducing emissions. Supporting farmers in this shift can reduce their operational costs while achieving these national goals.
CTCN Support
Undertake a feasibility study of the opportunities to solarise the irrigation systems of small-scale cane growers;
Consult with four local (and three South African) solar system developers and present a summary of their services, conditions and financing plans; 
Undertake a preliminary assessment of the solar energy needs for each farming company based on historical energy use profiles and develop a ranking system to prioritise farmer companies that would benefit the most from reduced energy costs;
Undertake a solar design assessment to provide an indicative system configuration for each farming company; 
Develop policy guidelines for the Government of Eswatini to promote solarized irrigation systems for sugar cane growers; 
Develop financing instruments to support this application of technology;
Prepare a generic funding proposal including the full variety of funding proposal requirements.
Expected Impact
An intervention to solarise sugar cane energy demand would represent an 11% saving nationally on energy use and 4.5% of national GHG emissions. The project will raise awareness of solar and service suppliers that will be required to support greater women’s participation. Women farmers and entrepreneurs will, through the development of a gender action plan during the writing of funding proposals, be encouraged and targeted to participate in the project.
Eswatini’s NDC aims for renewable energy resources to comprise 50% of the energy mix by 2022, thus its commitment can be partially met by reducing the emissions linked with electricity usage for irrigation. The project will support the following targets indicated in the NDC: 
Increasing the contribution of agriculture to economic development, to support both food security and exports;
Implementing small scale, decentralized renewable energy technologies to improve energy access in rural areas; and

A flurry of recent disasters in Malaysia has prompted increased concern over the impacts of extreme temperatures, strong winds and air pollution. These events have also revealed poor coordination and weak forecasting capacity for the prediction of floods and landslides, which has become increasingly important for major cities faced with the effects of climate change. 
The coastal communities of the Iskandar Malaysia (IM) economic region are at risk of flooding due to sea-level rise. Flooding causes the most frequent and significant damage and is responsible for a significant number of casualties, disease epidemics, property and crop damage. Among ASEAN member states, Malaysia’s population was the most exposed to floods between July 2012 and January 2019. Climate-related disasters are also posing huge challenges to public disaster management, which affects vulnerable groups. Ensuring clean water supply and optimal sewage services is particularly difficult during disasters like flooding, which can render food and water-borne diseases a threat. Climate change is also accelerating the rate of natural coastal erosion due to rising sea levels and there is the issue of haze, which has become an almost annual occurrence and is even more severe during the prolonged dry period associated with the El Nino phenomenon.
Malaysia has developed national plans to enhance resilience against climate change, but the approach has been largely reactive and focused on structural mitigation measures such as canalization of rivers, raising river embankments and building multi-purpose dams. Better prediction is needed to enable proactive action to be taken.
One of the main barriers to the development of improved models is a lack of contextualized data from detailed local risk assessment, as data acquisition is challenging for various parameters such as terrain, infrastructure, pollution sources, geology, weather history and geological events. The institutional framework to address climate change is also fragmented and requires capacity development at the local level. Furthermore, most models were developed in middle and higher latitudes, while the meteorological and atmospheric conditions in tropical regions can be much more complex. Therefore, local observations need to be incorporated into models to produce localized forecast information. Lastly, coastal zone management in IM requires expertise in big data analytics and capacity building for scenario planning and forecasting climate risks.
CTCN Support
The project will adapt carefully selected meteorological and hazard models for tropical conditions in IM and integrate them into the Iskandar Malaysia Multi-Hazard Platform (MHP), a common platform, which will be developed using technology similar to the Kuala Lumpur Multi-Hazard Platform. The platform will be used by the five local authorities in IM to support the management and communication of risks and strengthen the management of flash floods, landslides, sinkholes, strong winds, urban heat and air pollution in the region, thereby enhancing disaster resilience.
Expected Impact
This city-level forecasting system will provide the impetus for social innovation by facilitating community-level disaster preparedness and empowering special groups to participate in disaster risk reduction. Ultimately, the MHP will support increased emergency planning capacities through heightened awareness of critical events and disasters while protecting vulnerable communities and their livelihoods. 
Additionally, the MHP could support decision-making toward adaptive and holistic coastal zone management via specialist workshops and outreach events to enhance community awareness, and also through the provision of susceptibility maps for coastal hazards and floods. This could also include systematic monitoring and control measures to protect the existing mangrove areas, which have decreased at an alarming rate over the last few decades due to the development of the coastal region, intensified erosion, and the expansion of aquaculture activities.

Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate impacts, especially in the water sector where resources have been significantly depleted. One of the most susceptible districts is Ramechap, located above the Sunkoshi River, where the land is extremely dry and decreasing precipitation is severely impacting farmers. Water resources are especially vulnerable at high elevations where they are more sensitive to variability in rainfall patterns and timing, which contribute to increased drought frequency. 
Water resources for irrigation are the most profoundly affected, as landslides and debris flow have destroyed channels and stopped the water flow in streams, also lessening the availability of water for agricultural purposes. People have begun to look for other methods to fulfill their water needs, but efforts to address the major problem of disappearing springs and hill water have been insufficient, as various institutions have neglected water scarcity due to their limited capacity. 
Adaptation programs focusing on integrated water resources management are urgently needed. Barriers to the implementation of adaptation programs addressing watershed and hydrology include lacking financial resources, access to information and relevant technical data, infrastructure, skills and expertise, the lack of skilled personnel for the installation and operation of technologies, high levels of debt, and social practices, beliefs and norms that prevent the acceptance of climate adaptation options. 
The proposed project will address issues related to integrated water resources management for the Hill ecosystem through supporting the design of reviving ponds to increase water availability, providing irrigation for agriculture, and implementing agroforestry practices to support the livelihoods of local people.
CTCN Support
The project aims to address water scarcity problems by rehabilitating the traditional ponds in the community and developing new water management technology and infrastructure for water harvesting, groundwater recharge and solar lifting. Other activities include the formation of a farmers group and capacity development for agroforestry using harvested water, promotion of sprinkler and drip irrigation technology, and the dissemination of findings, including technical aspects, cost-benefit analyses, and operational guidelines for short and long-term income generation activities connected with the technologies.
Expected Impact
The project will contribute to increased livelihoods, biodiversity and social development in the form of knowledge transfer to the community. Agroforestry and vegetable farming activities will increase economic benefits and provide opportunities for capacity development. The project will contribute to Nepal’s NDC more generally through its work on three thematic areas of the NDC: Agriculture and Food Security; Forests, Biodiversity and Watershed Conservation; and Water Resources and Energy. It will also contribute through increasing water harvesting and supply, which directly aligns with the NDC measure on promoting rainwater harvesting and ponds construction. Through its focus on agroforestry, it will address the Afforestation and Enhancing Carbon Sequestration program.

Smallholder farmers in Ghana, who rely primarily on rainfed agriculture, are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In semi-arid northern Ghana, 90% of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture for their livelihoods. The predicted increase in temperature due to climate change could cause a decrease in the length of the wet season, an increase in rainfall intensity (i.e. increased risk of flooding), an increase in the number of dry days per month, and more frequent heatwaves. The fluctuating frequency and volume of rainfall directly affects water availability for agriculture, leading to decreased productivity for smallholder farmers and prolonged periods of food insecurity. The agriculture sector in Ghana employs about 47% of the country’s labour force, most of which are smallholder farmers who produce about 80% of the country’s total food. They are negatively impacted by a reliance on existing agricultural practices that still use rudimentary technology.
Solar powered irrigation systems (SPIS) provide a flexible and renewable energy source that would enable smallholder farmers to access water resources in an efficient manner during periods of water scarcity, benefiting productivity and food security. Rather than solely depending on rainfall for irrigation, smallholder farmers would benefit from irrigation systems that efficiently utilise available surface water and ground water reservoirs. SPIS provides reliable and affordable energy for irrigation especially in remote rural areas where diesel fuel is expensive or where access to electricity from the grid is lacking. As costs for solar powered irrigation systems (SPIS) have dramatically decreased over the past decade, solar technologies are becoming a viable option for smallholder farmers. Although SPIS technology has been widely introduced for agriculture in some countries, it has not as yet fully penetrated the Ghanaian market. Several barriers remain to its uptake, including high capital costs, lack of information and training, the absence of an integrated equipment supply chain and certification standards, access to finance and insufficient enabling policies and institutional frameworks. The government of Ghana has constrained resources, both in meeting the gap between formal and informal irrigation systems but also in the capacity and skills required for solar powered irrigation systems,
CTCN Support
Taking into consideration SPIS that build on any existing hard technology options and soft technology solutions that create an enabling environment to enable the uptake and dissemination of the technology (policy, financing, training), the objective is to provide a sustainable and efficient means of irrigation for smallholder farmers by providing the following:
bankable proof of technology concept, including available technology options best suited to smallholder farmers along with a cost-benefit analysis;
policy and legislature framework for technology standards and certification; 
financing structures targeted at smallholder farmers;
training modules for stakeholders across the supply chain. 
Expected Impact
Obtaining access to a sustainable source of water supply through SPIS could enable women engaged in agricultural practices in Ghana to improve agricultural productivity and food security for their families. In addition, providing solar irrigation solutions at the farm site will increase security for women, who have typically needed to walk long distances to access water, and allow them to spend their time on other activities. In addition, by increasing the productivity of smallholder farmers and targeting women specifically, it is more likely that additional revenue will be spent on healthcare, children’s education and nutritious meals.
Importantly, diesel use would be curtailed, reducing concerns regarding air pollution and other health issues. 
Lastly, the provision of SPIS would contribute to Ghana’s NDC, which references improved water resource management as an adaptation intervention, increased penetration of renewable energy solutions for rural areas, increased agriculture resilience for food security, and increased community-based conservation agriculture.  ",,,"Zero hunger, Good health and well-being, Clean water and sanitation, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, Climate action",

Mozambique is vulnerable to climate change and continues to be affected by extreme events such as floods, cyclones and droughts, which have a direct impact on agriculture. Most of the rural population lacks basic food and consumes just one meal per day. Water is scarce. Despite the fact that the country has been gradually introducing solar renewable energy projects into rural communities to provide electricity in rural areas, the agriculture sector has not benefited on a large scale. Photovoltaic systems would be a reliable source of electricity for irrigation purposes, as exemplified in some African countries that have introduced solar systems for crop irrigation. 
This project will introduce solar systems into rural communities for agricultural activities and involve women in the value chain of a business model called “Pay as you irrigate.” Its objective is to ensure that rural farmers can afford the crop field irrigation systems that contribute to offsetting the water deficit imposed by climate change. The end-users will be charged for the amount of water pumped to their farms and this money will be used for system maintenance and to increase crop production and diversification. A controlling mechanism will be used to monitor the amount of water used so that only the amount needed for the crops is provided, thus avoiding wasted water.  
CTCN Support 
Support is requested to obtain the optimal minimal cost configuration to match the PV system, groundwater pump and water distribution system in order to make the best use of solar energy. Statistical tools will be used to analyse the findings and the data analysis results will be disseminated to the public through presentations and publications. 
Expected Results
Ultimately, Mozambique will deploy several solar systems in rural farming areas as means to foster agricultural production, mitigate climate change, generate income, and eliminate famine among farmers and women in particular. 
Twelve women among twenty participants from each province will be trained in designing, implementing and managing solar systems for irrigation. They will then scale-up their knowledge and skills by training other women in their communities, including on topics such as climate change and its impact on agricultural activities, mitigation and adaptation plans. Ultimately, the skills acquired in the trainings will enable them to install small PV systems for multiple purposes in their communities.

A water crisis is worsening in Zambia, especially in drought-prone areas, due to the drying up of surface water resources. Climate change has reduced the amount of rainfall, forcing woman and children to walk longer distances to gain access to clean and safe water, and in turn shifting the focus toward the harnessing of groundwater resources. In Zambia, groundwater is a major source of domestic water and its use for irrigation is predicted to increase substantially to combat growing food insecurity. Groundwater constitutes an important buffer, serving as a water reserve during surplus periods as well as a vital water source during times of shortage. It is therefore slated to play an essential role in climate change adaptation. Despite this, there is little quantitative information on groundwater resources, as groundwater storage has been omitted from assessments of freshwater availability.
Aquifer mapping would provide an accurate and comprehensive micro-level picture of groundwater in Zambia and enable the development of a robust groundwater management plan that will provide drinking water security, improved irrigation facilities and sustainable development of water resources in rural and peri-ubran areas. The Department for Water Resources and Development (DWRD) Groundwater Division staff have some level of understanding of the aquifer mapping; however, the department does not have the most recent technology for operational forecasts and systems. The specific barriers to be addressed include a lack of modern equipment and data analysis tools and lacking expertise in aquifer identification and mapping, inadequate financial resources to support exploratory drilling, limited capacity to assess technological options, and lack of skilled personnel. Capacity development, knowledge and technical assistance are needed to develop aquifer management plans.
CTCN Support
The transfer of tools and methods for assessing the latest aquifer mapping and making the information available for long-term decision processes through the use of robust decision methods, thereby supporting climate resilient decision-making benefitting the water sector;

A prolonged review and support phase in which partners continue to play a marginal role after the project’s completion to support long-term sustainability. 
Expected Impact
Improved decision making through access to improved aquifer mapping information tools and technologies; 
Strengthening of staff skill sets and modelling capacity to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater resources;

The Peruvian Ministry of Environment, through the Directorate of Adaptation to Climate Change and Desertification, prepared a general roadmap for the Monitoring and Evaluation of Climate Change Adaptation Measures that includes four phases of: Analysis, Design, Development and Implementation. In order to build and advance in this roadmap, international experts have contributed in components such as Agriculture and Health. Currently, the Directorate for Adaptation to Climate Change and Desertification has prioritized the Water sector to advance in the establishment of the Monitoring and Evaluation of Adaptation Measures Component, which is part of the Monitoring System for Adaptation and Mitigation Measures.
The cross-cutting nature of adaptation measures in the thematic area of water represents a challenge in the consolidation of the M&E component, since it is necessary to harmonize and homogenize data systems at the national, regional and sectoral levels, a task that has not been carried out before at this level of complexity.
This technical assistance is focused on the development of the design phase for the thematic area of water adaptation measures and, in this way, contribute to the implementation of the monitoring and evaluation component for climate change adaptation measures, which makes use of existing monitoring and evaluation systems, provides guidelines for their improvement and proposes guidelines to involve local and national institutions in the implementation of an articulated system of indicators. 
CTCN Support
The overall objective of the technical assistance is to establish a baseline and roadmap for the Research, Development and Deployment of climate technologies for the reduction of GHG emissions in dairy farms, through the circularity of flows and materials and the use of emission mitigation technologies. The main activity is to identify and study climate technologies and circularity practices for the treatment and use of flows and materials:
• Development of a detailed work plan and related communication documents;
• Stakeholder mapping and creation of a RD&D focus group for scaling up the technical assistance results;
• Analysis of circularity in dairy farms and identification of the perceived value of the circular economy and its benefits in the dairy sector in Uruguay;
• Assessment of the feasibility of climate technologies applicable to dairy farms and their sustainability;
• Monitoring and evaluation of mitigation and circularity actions and knowledge sharing;
• Development of educational materials.
Expected Impact
It is expected that the monitoring and evaluation component will reflect international best practices and serves for reporting to international conventions, national climate change frameworks and donors. It will also allow to identify whether the implementation of adaptation measures is on track, as well as whether the measures are effective and how they can be improved.
It is expected that such a system will allow:
Evaluate the progress of adaptation interventions and quantify risk reduction, adaptive capacity, and the impact on populations affected by climate change.
Collect international best practices and enable reporting to international conventions and national climate change frameworks.
Establish a system to identify whether the implementation of adaptation measures is on track, as well as the effectiveness of the measures and possibilities for improvement.
Establish the effectiveness of measures that can be implemented in the future.
 
Technical assistance is also aimed at involving the relevant actors for climate change adaptation through the inclusion and articulation of existing information systems with the generation of new variables and analyses that complement them.

Peru’s updated NDC, submitted in 2020, has progressed in its formulation of more concrete adaptation measures. These are accompanied by indicators, goals and implementation deadlines for each prioritized thematic area, including agriculture, forests, fisheries and aquaculture, health and water. These adaptation measures have indicators for short (2021) and medium (2025) term goals. Peru’s regulations of the Framework Law on Climate Change establish a System for the Monitoring of Adaptation and Mitigation measures, and the Ministry of the Environment, through the General Directorate of Climate Change and Desertification, has developed a roadmap for the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation measures composed of four phases: i) analysis, ii) design, iii) development, and iv) implementation. The Directorate has prioritized the water sector going forward to continue advancing the establishment of the monitoring and evaluation component.
The establishment of a monitoring system for adaptation actions is essential to monitor the progress of interventions and track how they are reducing risks, improving adaptive capacity, and supporting  vulnerable populations.  The goal is for the system to be fully functional starting in 2023, and there are several outstanding needs to be addressed in order to achieve the goal in this timeframe. Thus far, international experts dealing with agriculture and health have been engaged in building and advancing this roadmap.

The cross-sectoral and transboundary nature of adaptation measures in the water thematic area presents challenges to consolidation of the M&E system since it is necessary to harmonize and homogenize data systems, which has not been done previously at this level of complexity.  The technical assistance targets the design phase for the M&E of water adaptation measures, making use of existing M&E systems and providing guidelines for the improvement of these current systems and guidance on how to involve local and national institutions in implementing them. Information will be collected on international best practices from international conventions and national frameworks on climate change. Measures being evaluated include population use, multisectoral management and energy use. Therefore, the ministries involved will be the Ministry of Housing, Construction and Sanitation (population use component), the National Water Authority (multisectoral management component), and the Ministry of Energy and  Mines (energy use component). The assistance will also identify barriers to M&E for adaptation measures, provide a financial sustainability analysis and the development of a concept note with recommendations for the management of climate funds that can support the completion of this endeavor.
Expected Results
The establishment of the M&E system will enable the assessment of progress on adaptation interventions and the quantification of risk reduction, adaptive capacity and impacts on populations affected by climate change. The assistance will also strengthen governance and sectoral planning and promote the integration of climate resilience into development planning. The financial strategy will identify financing mechanisms that can ensure the sustainability of the M&E system for water, while the concept note will be presented to international funding sources.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action",

The Hong-Thai Binh river basin is a transboundary river basin that encompasses 5 major tributaries (Da River, Red River, Chay River, Lo River, and Gam River) in three countries (China, Laos and Viet Nam). The river basin covers 25 provinces with a population of 29 million people. The use of water resources upstream in China has significantly affected the water regime of the Hong-Thai Binh river basin in Viet Nam. In addition, the impacts of climate change (e.g., drought, extreme/flash flood, etc.) have exacerbated challenges to communities and households. 
The government’s first priority is to finalize water resource management plans for the major river basins in the country, including the Hong-Thai Binh. Accessing reliable, up-to-date information on transboundary water resources is very important and plays a decisive role in developing water resource management plans at the river basin level. In particular, it is necessary to identify the amount of water flow from China into Viet Nam (e.g., average annual flow, monthly flow and 10 days flow) and its variation due to different water uses in China (including irrigation and human consumption), as well as due to climate change. However, there exists no formal data sharing agreement among the countries.
Viet Nam applied a hydrological model to convert rainfall data into runoff data. However, these data have large errors. Due to limited data availability, the simulations of water flow from China have errors of greater than 50%, compared with in-situ data. Viet Nam is currently using a statistical method, applying in-situ data from monitoring stations located at the border areas between two countries; however, this is a temporary solution, because the reliability of this method is still low. 
CTCN Support
The objective is to select and customize technologies that can provide science-based information on transboundary water resources. Previous and ongoing climate change risk and challenges to transboundary water resource management in the river basin will be identified, and the most appropriate technologies will be selected and customized to provide the selected data on the river basin. A technical manual and capacity building program will be developed. Subsequently, a training of government officials and relevant stakeholders will be conducted to enhance technical capacities. 
Expected Impact
The science-based information provided by the selected and customized technologies will contribute to more accurate, integrated planning for transboundary water resource management in the Hong-Thai Binh river basin, enhancing Viet Nam’s capacity to address water-related climate change risks and improving capacity for flood monitoring and warning. Preemptive flood prevention action and impact reduction can then be more efficiently and effectively provided to vulnerable groups, including women and youth.
The project will contribute to the country's updated NDC’s adaptation component, which identifies the following targets: improving adaptation efficiency through strengthening state management and resources; enhancing resilience and adaptive capacity of communities, economic sectors, and ecosystems; and reducing disaster risks and minimizing damage, increasing preparedness to respond.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Climate action",

Dominica is reliant on imported fossil fuels, leaving it vulnerable to global oil price fluctuations that directly impact the cost of electricity. The island revised its 2011 National Energy Plan in 2014 to state its objective of using sustainable and indigenous resources to become self-sufficient with regard to electricity generation by 2020, and to describe a scenario in which it becomes a net exporter of electricity from its geothermal resources. Renewable energy installations have the potential to lower the fuel charge portion of electricity rates and increase the reliability of electricity services through appropriate planning and operating procedures. Small solar energy generation units can contribute to the energy transition in Dominica. However, the island has not yet identified the feasibility and benefits of expanding self-sufficient renewable energy generation solutions that can reduce fossil fuel dependency. 
In addition, Dominica has an abundance of rivers and water sources. Supply systems are generally adequate to meet the demand. However, at some periods during the dry season, intermittent shortages can be experienced in a few of the systems. The Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) Policy mentions that in order to minimize problems associated with droughts, the Dominican Government will encourage and support optimization of the storage facilities to contain wet season runoff for use in the dry periods. In order to sustain water supply, the Government will promote harnessing and utilizing rainwater from roof catchments for individual households in cisterns or on a small scale in surface storage tanks, and developing a program to support retrofitting public buildings with water efficiency and conservation measures. 
CTCN Support
The overall objective of the technical assistance is to develop a technical and economic feasibility analysis of small solar generation units and water storage systems on public buildings in Dominica. The activities include the development of implementation planning and communication documents, review of existing solar generation units, analysis of current electricity and water consumption patterns and identification of appropriate technical options, identification of relevant stakeholders, impact analysis, financial feasibility analysis and modeling scenarios, and analysis of current barriers.

The technical assistance will chart a development pathway with economic, environmental, social and cultural co-benefits, as well as an emphasis on gender equality. Potential benefits include the creation of new jobs in the solar value chain, increased resilience of public buildings to future infrastructure damage from extreme climatological events, increased renewable energy utilization and reduced dependence on fossil fuels, and the promotion of a culture of sustainable development among the population.
The assistance will contribute to the achievement of Dominica’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which proposes mitigation measures to enhance resilience such as the “Solar Photovoltaic (PV) conversion program for Commercial, Institutional and Manufacturing Facilities” that includes schools, universities, hospitals, commercial buildings, manufacturing plants, government buildings, and municipal facilities.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

Belize is experiencing rising sea levels and increasing frequency and intensity of tropical storms due to climate change. This affects both groundwater quantity and quality, as it causes flooding in coastal agricultural areas and groundwater salinization. Fifty-six percent of the population lives in rural areas and relies on groundwater for agriculture and drinking water. However, the existing aquifers and their annual recharge rate have not been quantified. Given that the management of groundwater resources requires specialized knowledge, and in order to combat climate change and increase the resilience of these communities, quality assessment of water resources and capacity building are needed.
Since the 1980s, the National Hydrological Service (NHS) has been responsible for hydrological and water resources information. The NHS conducted an assessment on prior work of water wells in the northern part of the country and reported low availability of information on water quality, aquifer properties, rainfall and evapotranspiration. The agency also expressed an interest in helping draft a Climate Change Adaptation Technology Factsheet on groundwater resource monitoring for the northern districts to use as a basis for a Drought Early Warning System, and are leading the process for building an inventory of existing data on groundwater with the objective of identifying and streamlining information that is available but scattered among different agencies and institutions. 
CTCN Support
The CTCN will support the design of a groundwater quality monitoring system and identify risks to the supply of water for diverse groundwater users in Belize. In order to identify activities to address the situation, an analysis of groundwater offer and demand in a prioritized region will be conducted, followed by the design of the water availability assessment including water quality monitoring, and finally an analysis of political and technical instruments used at national and regional levels for planning, management, and quality monitoring of water resources.
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will provide a preliminary assessment of the groundwater situation and the vulnerability of the groundwater sources, guides and training materials, and a concept note for monitoring programme implementation. Capacity building will enhance the skills of people living in rural areas on water management governance, and improve clean water access. Improved control of water contamination will also positively impact biodiversity, human health, and the water quality of beaches and coastal ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs.

Climate change threatens Nepal’s agriculture sector, which is highly dependent on water and other climate-sensitive resources. The agriculture sector employs over two-thirds of the labor force and contributes to roughly one-third of the country's GDP. There is an urgent need to increase adoption of adaptive agricultural extension services to reinforce climate resilience in order to reduce climate change-induced loss of agricultural productivity. The timely dissemination of reliable weather and climate information are critical for management decisions such as selection of crop type and variety, planting and harvest timing, field fertilization, and grazing and migrating livestock.  Despite several efforts to improve climate information services, weather forecasts produced by national bodies are not widely disseminated in rural and remote areas.
CTCN Support
The objective of the technical assistance is to customize weather and climate information products issued by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology to the needs of local farmers. The assistance will support the development of an application programming interface (API) for the automatic dissemination of location-specific customized 3-day weather forecasts to farmers in user-friendly language using mobile and internet-based SMS. The dissemination system will then be piloted in selected communities to build farmers’ capacity to use this information.
Expected Impact
The increased use of improved meteorological services for decision-making in the agriculture sector provides economic and social benefits. The technical assistance will help farmers to better adapt to changing weather conditions, reducing risks to agricultural production and leading to enhanced food security. The technical assistance will support the targets for the Agriculture, Forestry and Land Use (AFOLU) sector articulated in Nepal’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), as it will test a customized set of weather forecast products for smallholder farmers for increased access to climate-smart agricultural technologies. Additionally, the project will strengthen and establish Public Weather Services (PWS), which falls under the country’s key policy priorities on adaptation. The project will integrate the Gender Equality and Social Inclusion NDC target through involving women, children, youth, indigenous peoples, and marginalized groups in consultations and workshops at national, district and village levels.

Mozambique suffers from regularly occurring extreme events such as heavy storms and severe droughts that threaten the economic system and the livelihoods of its population. Following the significant drought that occurred in 2016, the GDP growth decreased by approximately 50% compared to the previous fiscal year. To better adapt to climate change and water-related extreme events in particular, the government developed a water sector action plan in 2018 based on the country’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) and the national adaptation strategy, which aimed to increase water storage capacity by 30%. Subsequently, the comprehensive national program entitled PRAVIDA (‘water for life’ in Portuguese) was initiated and proved a success during its first phase which ended in 2020.The National Institute of Irrigation (INIR) is responsible for application of the rainwater harvesting system and has tried to enhance farmland by increasing water accessibility, given that only 3% of farmland is irrigation-equipped. INIR has installed irrigation infrastructure, largely in the south. However, the country still requires technical and financial assistance to achieve the national goal—extended water storage capacity throughout the country.
CTCN Support
The CTCN will support the exploration of possible rainwater harvesting system options and undertake a technical assessment to identify the most appropriate system, especially for agricultural use, by determining applicability and effectiveness and providing a cost-benefit analysis. The outputs will also include a concept paper for proposals to international climate and ODA funds.
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will contribute to the implementation of adaptation strategies and help drought-prone areas secure water for agriculture through rainwater harvesting. Rainwater harvesting systems will improve agricultural production and benefit a large portion of the population, as more than 75% are employed in the agriculture sector. Since women comprise a significant portion of the workforce, they will greatly benefit from this assistance. ",,,"Zero hunger, Clean water and sanitation, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action",

Guided by Gross National Happiness, a sustainable and holistic approach to development, Bhutan is making rigorous conservation efforts and remains the only carbon-negative country in the world. According to the GHG emission time series data from 1994 – 2015, Bhutan continues to sequester more carbon than it emits with net national emission of -5,572.500 Gg of CO2eq in 2015. Further, the nation aspires to remain carbon-neutral for all times. However, Bhutan’s GHG emission (excluding removal by sink) has been increasing and has almost doubled in 2015 compared to 1994 figures. 
As for the waste management and related sector, while emissions is relatively low, it has still increased by 126.79% compared to the 1994 – 2015 period (Final Draft TNC, 2020). Such increased emissions is due to the increased waste generation is triggered by population growth, rapid urbanization and rural urban migration which poses a significant threat to the environment due to minimal treatment, recovery and recycling of wastes.
An innovative financial mechanism is essential to the holistic waste management practice as without it, addressing waste management in Bhutan is likely to remain difficult. In fact, the lack of suitable and dependable financial support for the waste sector has been a key barrier to proper waste management in the country as shortage of funds have resulted in inadequate capacity, technology, tools, equipment and workforce in the sector. Thus, a sustainable and innovative financial mechanism is the most important tool that underpins the successful implementation of the key interventions in the sector. It has also been emphasized as a key strategy in the National Waste Management Strategy of 2019.
CTCN Support
To develop waste management payment and sustainable operation strategies.
Expected Impact
Achieved sustainable waste management towards establishing a circular economy in Bhutan. Sustainable waste management has the potential to bring about economic, environmental, social and gender-sensitive development impacts. Economic co-benefits will arise from the creation of over 2000 job opportunities primarily through private sector involvement. Economic benefits can also be accrued through the production of energy using waste as raw materials. The environmental co-benefits of curtailing GHG emissions and reducing contamination of land, air and water extend well beyond Bhutan’s geographical boundaries. With regards to the social co-benefits, substituting the import of chemical fertilizers through the production of organic compost using organic waste would help Bhutan reduce budget deficit while also contributing to the national food security. Further, improved waste management will not only have a positive impact on the tourism sector (the second highest revenue generating sector for Bhutan), but also lead to healthier citizens which would in turn reduce the public health cost of the government.",,,,

Georgia is a rich forested country (approximately 40% of the area). A massive wildfire was raging in Borjomi - Kharagauli National Park in the summer of 2017. It lasted over a month. The protected territory of Borjomi - Kharagauli is in a central part of the Caucasian throat and includes the eastern part of the Lesser Caucasus mountains. The uncontrolled fires can put such ecological values in danger due to the increased number of visitors. 
Short and long-term impacts on the specific values of the protected territories, especially natural fires, forest massif diseases caused by pests and climate change need special attention. Administration of the protected territories should maintain balance and, on the one hand, allow to develop the natural processes to identify the environmental condition of the protected territories and, on the other hand, focus on those specific values the protection, conservation, and maintenance of which is the responsibility of the Agency of Protected Areas, project proponent of this technical assistance.
A site-specific fire monitoring policy will allow local populations with high risks of exposure to forest fire hazards to take appropriate actions to avoid or reduce risks and to prepare effective responses will be redacted, and users and administrators of the future system trained to its functionalities. Preservation of forests contributes to the significant reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) removal towards the improvement of the resilience of ecosystems to climate change while minimizing the impact of extreme weather phenomena such as flooding. Therefore, it is very important to develop a system for early detection of wildfires towards protecting the environment contributing to climate change resiliency.
CTCN Support

The UNFCCC has identified the Circular Economy as ‘crucial for the Paris Climate Goals’. On the premise that there is a strong link between climate change and materiality, the Global Circularity Gap Report (2012) argues that additional contributions to NDCs can be made by implementing dematerializing and decoupling Circular Economy strategies globally. While South Africa has identified the important role of the Circular Economy in combating climate change, a clear narrative and strategy to drive the shift to a green economy and economic growth is still missing. An overarching national circular economy policy strategy is needed to encourage coordination and collaborations amongst the government departments and its major stakeholders, including the private sector. The development of a Science, Technology and Innovation-led strategy in the form of a Roadmap for Circular Economy can present a strong policy coordination and planning tool for national departments to clarify their contributions and responsibilities.
CTCN Support
The CTCN shall support the Department of Science and Innovation to establish the appropriate process and cooperation to develop a Circular Economy Roadmap for South Africa based on evidence-led and knowledge-based policy making to drive the transition to a circular economy from a systems perspective and taking into account the results of Material Flow Analysis.
Expected Impact 
The objective is to assist in the effective development of a country-specific STI-led circular economy roadmap, aimed at addressing sustainable resource utilization in South Africa, and with it, climate mitigation and adaptation. This initiative is expected to highlight experiences and identify the circular economy value, definition of benefits, weaknesses, opportunities and challenges, as well as potential projects in South Africa. Thus, raising awareness on the contribution of the Circular Economy in the country and to inform future policy and planning. The roadmap will also assist government departments and stakeholders to fast-track a transition to a Circular Economy in the country and to prioritize and collaborate on the most impactful interventions. This request aligns the National Development Plan goals of South Africa and supports its NDC goals with a clear Circular Economy Roadmap to transition from its international mitigation commitment from a relative “deviation from Business-as-usual” to an absolute peak, plateau and decline greenhouse gas emissions trajectory range.

Tanzania is largely dependent on imported fossil and unrefined biomass fuels for economic and transport activities. The country’s primary mode of transport is motor vehicles, which create emissions. Due to its rapid urbanization and increasing individual motorization, traffic congestion and air pollution have increased alongside GHG emissions. Dar es Salaam is ranked as the third fastest growing city in Africa, where public transport depends on a large fleet of privately-owned minibuses that are often not well maintained to keep on the road. Electric mobility has been recognized as a viable and attractive option that can create jobs, reduce energy imports, and spur green growth. In line with its National Transport Policy, which envisions improving the transport sector’s efficiency, cost-effectiveness, accessibility and environmental degradation, Tanzania is seeking technical assistance for the development of an e-mobility program and implementation framework. The country has implemented policies and strategies to promote renewable energy technologies in various sectors of the economy. However, there has been no specific initiative or effort directly targeting e-mobility, nor any accompanying standards, guidelines, or regulations.
CTCN Support
The overall objective is to develop a national e-mobility program and implementation framework. Activities include a benchmark analysis of international policy, national market readiness and cost assessment for uptake of e-mobility. The policy and the implementation framework will include the development of a technology roadmap, suitable investment plans, a detailed feasibility study for the selected interventions, and capacity development activities for relevant stakeholders. Financing models will also be identified and a GCF concept note will be prepared to seek financing for the purpose of technology development, piloting, and transfer.
Expected Impact
Transportation networks are a fundamental element of infrastructure and will improve access to essential resources for rural and vulnerable populations. Women are highly under-represented in the transport sector, which is largely managed and operated by men. The transition to more efficient transport technologies presents an opportunity to increase women’s participation and to provide them with socioeconomic opportunities in new business models. The transition will also reduce the detrimental public health implications of using motorized transport equipment. The technical assistance is aligned with Tanzania’s Nationally Determined Contribution, which aims at promoting the use of renewable energy in transportation systems.

Climate variability and change has become a major threat to sustainable development in Zambia. The country is already experiencing climate induced hazards which include drought and dry spells, seasonal and flash floods and extreme temperatures. Some of these hazards, especially the droughts and floods have increased in frequency and intensity over the past few decades and have adversely impacted food and water security, water quality, energy and livelihoods of the people, especially in rural communities. The aggregated estimated total GDP loss by sector is in the range of USD 4,330-5,440 million. 
Innovation is seen as a relevant tool with a double benefit, to respond to the adverse impacts of climate change, and to generate economic growth. As a structured approach to fostering innovation is required, the concept of national innovation systems (NIS) has been introduced and widely adopted.
Zambia has communicated clear ambitions of fostering innovation and aspires to become a prosperous low carbon and climate resilient middle income country by 2030 as enshrined in its Vision 2030. However, to date, most initiatives to increase its innovative capacities were uncoordinated and with limited success.

According to the Global Climate Risk Index for 2021, Zimbabwe was amongst the world’s 10 most affected countries by climate change in 2019. The last three decades have seen increased variability in the seasonal distribution of rainfall, an increase in day-time and night-time average temperatures, increased incidences of intense rainfall interspaced by long dry spells, and late onset and early secession of rains. Zimbabwe has also seen an increase in extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, flash floods and tropical cyclones. The impacts of climate change in Zimbabwe are being felt throughout all sectors of the economy, including the infrastructure sector.
Zimbabwe – like much of Africa – is constrained by an inability to fully implement sustainable building practices, adopt environmentally friendly technologies and put appropriate measures in place to respond to climate change requirements. This is largely attributed to a lack of institutional and financial resources. The concern of environment and sustainable development within the built environment has increased recently in Zimbabwe. Therefore, the country established different institutions that concern sustainable issues that include environmental, social, and economical besides non-governmental organizations. 
There is now, to a greater extent, a desire to develop policies, tools and regulations as an approach ensuring sustainable development within the built environment through waste reduction and efficient provision of infrastructure. There is an urgent need to look at domestic systems and modify them through establishing new building systems and practices based on green thinking and applications. As a result, Zimbabwe needs to develop sustainable practices, there is a need to improve the environmental and economic performance of new and existing commercial, institutional, and residential buildings. In order to make green building practices easier to implement, the ultimate goal is to develop technical services and resources for determining the greenness of buildings based on an appropriate green building compliance system.
CTCN Support
To support the achievement of targets set by the Government of Zimbabwe under various Conventions through the development of the Green Building Standards.
Expected Impact
The Green Building Standards for Zimbabwe will ensure an environmentally responsible construction sector and buildings. The Green Building Standards will also promote positive economic, environmental, health and social benefits through incorporating energy efficiency systems, efficient water systems and integrated waste management within the design and construction sector. 
The development of The Green Building Standards for Zimbabwe, which will be aligned to updated Building By-laws and implemented nationally, will result in the energy efficient improvements. This would help to reduce energy consumption. The energy saving interventions will directly contribute towards the attainment of Zimbabwe’s 40% per capita greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in its revised Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). At the same time, thermal comfort levels can be increased to comply with normal requirements and generate substantial social and economic benefits with the reduction of healthcare costs, reduction of operation and maintenance costs, improvement of productivity of public services and generally better-quality public services for public including the most vulnerable.

The construction industry is currently responsible for more than 23% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and for 30% of global resource consumption. Maintaining this pattern in this sector, which depends on carbon-intensive machinery and materials, threatens to put the world on a fast track towards a global temperature rise of 3°C or more by 2050 (C40, 2020). 
In Mexico City, 65% of construction and demolition waste (CDW) reported in terms of impact (461,276.61 m3/year) were sent to final disposal sites (SEDEMA, 2020). In addition, the 2016 edition of the Mexico City Emissions Inventory, reported that this sector contributed 5.05 tonnes of emissions of toxic compounds per year. These figures reveal the significant losses incurred, year after year, of valuable materials, products and components and the economic losses and negative effects on the entire materials value chain. Also, the poor disposal of this type of waste causes strong environmental impacts, especially in areas of environmental value, such as ravines, where waste is deposited illegally, while it also generates additional emissions from its transportation, because much of this waste is dumped in neighboring states since Mexico City has no final disposal sites. 
Sustainability is one of the guiding axes of the Mexico City Governance Plan, 2019-2024. The circular economy is a driver of development that will make it possible to take advantage of opportunities for the revalorization of materials flows, which will contribute to the mitigation of socio-environmental impacts and generate direct economic benefits for businesses and local communities. 
CTCN Support
Provide technical support from specialists in the field of the circular economy and the technologies of Industry 4.0 for the development of a platform for the interchange of materials derived from construction and demolition, for the transition towards the circular economy in Mexico City. The created marketplace-type platform is expected to serve as a pilot project for application at the national level.
The assistance includes an analysis of the current situation of the construction and demolition sector from the perspective of the circular economy; the development of a proposed business model based on the analysis of the political, regulatory and incentive environment; and the creation of monitoring indicators. The platform's prototype will be trialed in a pilot and manuals for its users and administrators will be developed. In addition, a sectoral work group will be created to consult on key assistance inputs.
Expected Impact
The outcome of the assistance is the development of a platform for the interchange of materials from construction and demolition for the transition towards the circular economy in Mexico City, to serve as a pilot project for application at the national level.
This project is also expected to have important co-benefits such as the creation of green jobs. It is also expected that the implementation of the platform will bring a reduction in the extraction of material resources and in the generation of waste, having a positive impact on the reduction of GHG emissions and damage to ecosystems. This will, in turn, reduce the financial cost to the city of removing this waste and sending it to final disposal sites in neighboring states. These savings can be invested in actions that contribute to better waste management in the city. 
In the social sphere, this type of action promotes the development of awareness around the environmental, economic and social benefits that circular economy schemes bring, providing alternatives and solutions for the use of waste.",,,,

Mozambique has a long coastline affected by extreme weather events such as cyclones. During the 2018-2021 period, cyclones Idai, Keneth, and Ana caused myriad deaths and injuries, alongside the destruction of homes, health units, schools, and crops. The impact of extreme events is predicted to worsen, affecting the most vulnerable sectors including agriculture, water resources and energy. Since the country is highly dependent on agriculture, it is imperative to implement smart agriculture practices that increase productivity, improve food security, bolster resilience, and restore degraded agro-ecosystems. 
An estimated 80% of producers in the Central region of Mozambique, specifically in the Zambezi Valley, use motor pumps in the irrigation process, which significantly contributes to water pollution through the spillage of oils, lubricants and fuel. The use of fuels fossil (charcoal and firewood) contributes to air pollution, as does the reliance upon inorganic fertilizers. There is a lack of capacity and technical knowledge for the dissemination and adoption of sustainable technologies due to the absence of a local budget for the management and implementation of climate resilience programs and a sustainable mechanism for the continuity of post-financing projects, as well as lacking interinstitutional coordination and access to basic information on the technology diffusion process that underpins decision-making. 
CTCN Support
The objective of this technical assistance is to develop a fit for purpose system for one selected farm in the Zambezi Valley that includes aquaponic, biodigester, bio composting, and hydraulic management systems (including water storage and solar pumping integrated systems for drip irrigation). The assistance will diagnose the needs of local farmers and benchmark international best practices and develop a complete flowchart of the system including the collection and pumping of the water through the photovoltaic system, the use of integrated reservoirs for fish production coupled with horticulture (aquaponics), the generation of compost, and the generation of biogas and biofertilizers as well as organic food for the selected farm. The cost of the fit-for-purpose system will be estimated, and finally, training materials and workshops will be developed.
Expected Impact
The system will reduce GHG emissions through the use of biogas and clean energy, reduce the use of inorganic fertilizers, develop efficient irrigation systems, increase food and nutrition security, and support income generation.  It is expected that additional funding will be leveraged to test and pilot the system in a second location and to scale it up to other locations in the Zambezi and throughout the country. The technical assistance is aligned with Mozambique’s NDC, updated in November 2021, in which agriculture is featured as a top priority alongside improved capacity for integrated water resources management, including the building of climate resilient hydraulic infrastructure. Additionally, the assistance will support the improved integration of women in the water-food-energy nexus.

Around 93% of the wastewater generated by the densely populated Namangan province is discharged with a high risk of leakage to rivers and agricultural areas. As most areas are not connected to any wastewater treatment system, wastewater leakage threatens to contaminate the water, soil and food crops of the region.
The topography of the region prevents the gravitational flow of wastewater, the high costs to connect sanitation to a centralized system and a low willingness of the population to pay higher tariffs for wastewater treatment add to the complexity of the problem. In addition to the amount of non-safely managed sludge in the Namangan province faces energy security issues and is highly dependent on hydrocarbon energy sources. 
Uzbek authorities see a potential solution in technology to produce biogas from human fecal waste, thus providing a localized solution on wastewater treatment and reducing the dependence on fossil fuel.  However, the technology for this is currently lacking in the country, as well as the prospect for private companies to generate a profit by recycling wastewater. 
CTCN Support
The government of Uzbekistan has asked for CTCN support to conduct a feasibility study of wastewater to biogas potential in rural settlements that takes the socioeconomic, environmental and topographic conditions into consideration. It shall also support a pilot project for a small-scale production facility that is capable of producing biogas by recycling human fecal waste from decentralized sanitation systems. Lastly, the CTCN shall support the attraction of investment with potential international investors and development grants. 
Expected Impact 
The aim is to pilot an innovative approach that enables the development of localized sanitation systems and energy security. A newly developed localized sanitation system can have the advantage over centralized systems due to its relatively small operating costs and has the potential to create new jobs for the local unemployed population. The request helps to ensure sanitation for all and contributes to the NDC of Uzbekistan and its goal to increase the amount of generated energy from renewable sources to 25% of all the generated power by 2030, increase energy efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 10% by 2030.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Affordable and clean energy, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action",

Niger's economy is mainly based on agriculture with 75% of the working population and 40% of GDP depending considerably on the availability of water resources. However, in recent decades, agricultural production in the Sahel region and particularly that of Niger has experienced a general downward trend caused by an increase of drought and floods. The rainfall on which the agricultural sector and livestock largely depend is highly irregular. The most recent climate change projections show a trend towards further intensification of rainfall and an increase in the duration of dry episodes during the agricultural season. These environmental and climatic changes have profoundly changed the hydrology of artificial ponds and natural reservoirs that play an important role in hosting vegetable crops, rice cultivation, fruit trees and providing water to livestock and migratory birds. Despite this situation, there are no quantitative estimates of the sedimentation rate of Niger’s ponds and reservoirs, and no predictive model of their storage capacity and lifespan in the dry season. It is also unknown how soil moisture changes according to rainfall in different types of soils. Due to this, Niger seeks to increase its knowledge on soil moisture dynamics and pond dynamics to prepare climate change adaptation policies and increase agricultural resilience. 
CTCN Support 
Niger’s national adaptation priorities focus on improving the resilience of the agriculture, livestock and forestry subsectors. The CTCN shall support Niger in its objective to generate 18 months’ worth of data to develop predictive models of the hydrological and sedimentary dynamics of temporary ponds and small reservoirs in the Sahel to improve climate smart agriculture models. This includes the identification of a set of about fifty ponds and temporary reservoirs of different sizes in watersheds with various characteristics and acquiring a high-resolution topography of these ponds during the dry season and before and after each rain to analyze water dynamics and generate predictive models. 
Expected Impact
The project shall ultimately serve decision-makers, farmers and herders to make important decisions for the short-, medium- and long-term productivity of livestock and agriculture in Niger. Examples include predictions at the end of the rainy season, whether a pond or a reservoir will be able to meet the usual needs of the population and ecosystems during the dry season and whether the level of services provided by pond or reservoir are likely to decrease significantly in the medium or long term due to rainfall or sedimentation. Furthermore, it shall also help to identify necessary interventions (over-digging, watershed treatment) required to maintain the level of service of an artificial pond or reservoir and identify the best place to create an artificial reservoir that can provide a given amount of water during a given period of time. This Technical Assistance ultimately supports Niger’s NDC to reach its adaptation and food security goals, as well as its focus on climate-smart agriculture by improving the expertise on climate information, early warning and risk and disaster management. It also contributes to the preservation and partial restoration of biodiversity hit by droughts. ",,,"Climate action, Life on land",

Today, much of the precipitation in the Seychelles falls in sharp bursts, creating heavy flooding in the wet season, while imposing extended periods of drought during the dry season. Climate change projections in the Seychelles predict more intense rainfalls and drought periods. As the country does not have a large water storage capacity, and the topography of the islands constrains such infrastructure, water supplies are heavily dependent on rainfall. Furthermore, the coastal zone is vulnerable to flooding, because of rising sea surface levels and increased storm surges from cyclonic activity in the Western Indian Ocean. Therefore, water management has become a priority in the Seychelles with a particular focus on water policy and watershed management. The Seychelles seek to integrate environmental considerations in cross-sectoral policies and to streamline national and international commitments related to climate change adaptation.
CTCN Support
Following the recommendation of a geotechnical and financial feasibility study of wetland creation that was prepared during the implementation of an Adaptation Fund Programme, the CTCN will support with this Fast Technical Assistance to formulate a pre-concept proposal to the Innovation Facility of the Adaptation Fund (AF). This pre-concept note will support the confirmation of the AF's interest in financing the detailed design phase (and potentially the implementation) of the innovative water retention structure in “La Drisse” depression in the Mare-aux-Cochons watershed in Seychelles. The aim is to sustainably manage the watershed to secure freshwater resources that are essential for climate change resilience on Mahé.  
Expected Impact 
The expected impact of this Fast Technical Assistance is to leverage financing to enhance the hydrological management of the Seychelles and address two major water supply challenges. On the one hand, it will address the need to transfer water towards the zones of treatment and consumption (from the West to the East), and on the other hand, to increase storage capacity in the Seychelles. This Fast Technical Assistance also contributes to the NDC objectives of the Seychelles to improve adaptation in terms of energy and water security and to improve community resilience.",,,"Clean water and sanitation, Climate action",

The population of the Maldives (540,000) is dispersed over 188 islands that do not possess fresh surface water. The freshwater resources of the Maldives are scarce, both in temporal and spatial terms, and mainly available from groundwater aquifers that occur in the porous coral sand from rainfall. 
In the past, drinking water was extracted from these shallow aquifers using hand-dug open wells. However, in many inhabited islands of the Maldives fresh groundwater has been depleted, because of salt-water intrusion due to over-extraction. In addition to that, these freshwater resources are vulnerable and susceptible to contamination from land-based human activities. A growing number of the population is now reluctant to use groundwater for drinking or cooking, as the quality has deteriorated. 
Sea-level rise and changes in precipitation patterns resulting from climate change have increased the frequency and intensity of flooding events in the country, further affecting the scarce freshwater resources. The Republic of Maldives has identified the establishment of drainage systems in the islands as an effective measure to mitigate and reduce the effects of flooding to preserve the fresh ground water lenses on the island. The development of design criteria and technical specifications for sustainable storm water management systems is therefore needed. 
CTCN Support
The CTCN will support with the preliminary investigation of storm water and drainage systems, conduct reviews on other regulations, guidelines and polices being used in similar Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and conduct stakeholder meetings to discuss the finalized draft of the Technical Specifications Guideline. Thus, contributing to the establishment of drainage systems to reduce the effects of flooding and preserve fresh ground water lenses in the Maldives. 
Expected Impact 
The objective is to assist with the guidelines needed to develop the design criteria and technical specifications for sustainable storm water management systems. The expected impact is to set a new standard for sustainable development and infrastructure in the islands of the Maldives.  This Technical Assistance contributes to the NDC goal and the Maldives Climate Emergency Act to build flood resilient island communities and climate proof infrastructure as well as investing in flood mitigation measures.",,,"Industry, innovation and infrastructure, Sustainable cities and communities, Climate action",

Peru is vulnerable to the increased intensity and frequency of extreme events due to climate change, such as floods produced by El Niño, droughts, frosts, fires in the Amazon, and the retreat of the Andean glaciers. Mitigation targets were set for Peru’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in the energy, industrial processes, agriculture, land use, land use change and forestry and waste sector. Likewise, adaptation measures were established for five prioritized sectors, including water, health, fisheries and aquaculture, forest and agriculture, and more recently transport and tourism. For all of these targets, early warning systems are a key mechanism to combat the increased risk and depend fundamentally on observation systems. The input of highly accurate meteorological and hydrological information to identify the temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation, radiation and wind is essential to support studies on renewable energy as well.  
SENAMHI organizes, operates, maintains and controls the National Network of Meteorological, Hydrological, Agrometeorological and Atmospheric Monitoring Stations, in accordance with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The National Observational System includes the National Network of Stations and also provides data management and the processing and delivery of observational information to users. However, it is currently unable to adequately cover the diverse climates in the country resulting from the geographic diversity. Computational capabilities are insufficient for the development and use of numerical models and in processing satellite information to generate observational products. More than 600 National Network stations are manual or conventional, requiring a person for their operation. Lastly, the National Network requires continuous maintenance, which proves challenging due to budgetary constraints and a lack of human resources. A comprehensive diagnosis, optimization and redesign of the National Observational System is needed to meet the growing needs of internal and external users in the face of climate change. 
CTCN Support
Technical assistance has been requested to develop a modern and multipurpose observational system. The expected activities include a diagnosis and identification of the principles and criteria for the diagnosis, optimization and redesign of the observational system. A cost estimate and comparison against alternatives are also requested, as well as the identification of potential sources of financing and investment risks, and the drafting of a concept note for climate fund resources.
Expected Impact
Observational systems provide a framework to manage climate risks, as they generate information that enables taking action to save lives. These systems also monitor atmospheric conditions of greenhouse gases and air pollution that can affect human health. Additionally, the systems generate more accurate information that can be used for scientific research on the environment, climate change, and natural hazards. Meteorological and hydrological information is essential for the integral management of climate change and is key for the implementation of adaptation and mitigation measures toward achieving Peru’s NDC.

According to Jamaica’s Food and Nutrition Security Policy, the island counts with low food production and high dependency on imported food, putting approximately 12.8% (400,000) of Jamaica’s population in food insecurity. As a Small Island Developing State (SIDS), Jamaica is also vulnerable to the negative impacts associated with climate change. This may result in the loss of agricultural lands due to direct erosion, temporal flooding and contamination of the agricultural soil via salination, hence impacting livelihoods, production and economic output. The situation has been further compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic.
While the agricultural producing parishes across the island are well known, significant knowledge and technology gaps still remain. Policy makers as well as sector stakeholders have so far been unable to identify the food insecure regions across the island in relation to climate change. Knowledge on the spatial distribution of current and future food security risks across the island that ranges from the community scale to the parish level is therefore pivotal. 
CTCN Support 
Through the technical assistance, the CTCN will support Jamaica to increase its adaptive capacity and resiliency of the agriculture sector. Key questions of how changing climate conditions align with food scarcity and food prices shall be answered. 
The development of a technological tool/software application shall support with a visual representation of food security risk and the spatial vulnerability of food insecure areas across the island to provide decision-makers with a holistic assessment of vulnerability to food insecurity and clarify areas or hot spots that may need to be targeted for intervention strategies. 
Expected Impact 
The expected impact is to contribute to more food system resiliency that anticipates risks and withstands economic and environmental shocks, therefore improving human development in Jamaica. The objective is to crystalize in a detailed manner food insecure or vulnerable communities across the island, the reasons for food insecurity and vulnerability as well as prognostics and potential solutions to improve their situations. Another expected outcome is to close significant knowledge and technology gaps to address current and future food security risks across rural and urban environments. By developing a baseline survey, Jamaica can shed light on the determinants and consequences of food insecurity within the context of climate change. The CTCN’s technical assistance is expected to provide an opportunity to generate country-wide data in a disaggregated format to capture the gendered nuances of food insecurity under changing climatic conditions.
 
The technical assistance is aligned with the island’s development policies, plans and strategies that target a reduction of food poverty and an increased adaptation to changing climatic conditions. It also supports Jamaica’s NDC with its strategic aims to facilitate the use of efficient agricultural methods, improved food storage systems, and diversifying food production techniques including the expansion of agroforestry and aquaculture.

Panama is vulnerable to the effects of climate change, including fluctuating rainfall patterns and tropical storms, which have inflicted serious damage in recent years. Currently, 45% of Panama’s installed electricity generation capacity comes from hydroelectric sources, which are susceptible to capacity loss for prolonged periods due to either extreme drought, or intense rain and flooding. To avoid blackouts, the country has resorted to the use of thermal generation plants that rely on fossil fuels. The linear transmission system linking opposite ends of the country has not been configured to account for the effects of climate change, and while these impacts are evident in the stability of the power generation system,  little  attention has been given thus far to the sector’s vulnerability. Ensuring the sustainable development of the energy sector requires assessing these impacts along the sector’s supply chain to identify current knowledge gaps and areas for the development and implementation of measures that can increase resilience while reducing GHG emissions, as energy is also a target sector for mitigation.

Samoa’s existing forests serve as crucial habitat for indigenous species as well as an important carbon sink which could be absorbing up to 800,000 t CO2 annually. Several government initiatives have played a role in protecting Samoa’s forest resources, including establishment of national parks, bans on commercial logging, reforestation programs, and community forest programs. Samoa’s updated NDC aims to expand the area under agroforestry to an additional 5 percent of agricultural land by 2030 relative to 2018, which will also help protect crops from cyclone damage, diversify agricultural incomes, and reduce flood risk. Secondly, Samoa aims to manage forests sustainably and increase total forest cover by 2 percent by 2030 relative to 2013 to moderate stream flow, protect indigenous ecosystems, preserve cultural values, and maintain the supply of non-timber forest products. However, there have been no efforts to map Samoa's forests and estimate the carbon sinks. Samoa needs to improve data and information on forests, deforestation and forest degradation.
CTCN Support
This technical assistance will develop a framework and methodology to map the forest using Earth observation and carbon sink estimation while identifying possible issues and opportunities to link to the international carbon trading market through efforts to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD+). The activities will include mapping vegetation and general land cover, classifying forest and land cover categories, assessing map accuracy through field data collection, defining a methodology and creating a model to estimate the amount of carbon that could be stored or captured through each land category, analyzing the REDD+ definition along with Samoan national strategies for REDD+ and identifying potential barriers and opportunities, and developing a framework to support Samoa in managing forests sustainably and monitoring landscape changes.

In the Pacific, both air and sea surface temperatures are projected to increase in coming years due to the effects of climate change. In addition, over the past decade several environmental issues have worsened, including increased unsustainable harvesting of coastal fishery resources, degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems such as mangroves, coral reefs, and seagrass beds; increased groundwater pollution; and a loss of biodiversity due to invasive species, degradation of land resources through unsustainable forestry and poor agricultural practices, and excessive conversion of forest land to alternative uses, climate variability, and sea level rise. The economy of the Solomon Islands is based on agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, which together account for around 40 per cent of GDP and provide employment for the majority of the population. 
Coastal areas encompass diverse ecosystems supporting a variety of living and non-living resources, and also provide many ecosystem services that support the population, such as seagrass beds and mangrove habitats, with coral reefs comprising the primary coastal protection structures while also providing an important source of food and employment for coastal communities throughout the Pacific. The Government of Solomon Islands considers it urgent to develop the capacity of the country to assess risks and vulnerabilities associated with climate change, to reduce risks, and adapt to the predicted impacts. For the Solomon Islands, the objective of developing an Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) framework is to protect the mangroves through ecosystem-based adaptation solutions. 
CTCN Support
This technical assistance will support the formulation of an ICZM policy framework to protect mangroves through ecosystem-based adaptation solutions. Over the longer term, the framework aims to balance environment, socio-economic, cultural, and recreational objectives; reduce ecosystem degradation; conserve and maintain existing ecosystems; and involve local communities or stakeholders in sustainable environmental management decisions.

The circular economy has been acknowledged as an effective strategy to achieve climate objectives by 11 countries in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region in their NDCs. Of these countries, 6 (Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay) have a national circular economy strategy or policy. However, these countries do not yet have a standard methodology for estimating the impact of circular economy policies and actions on mitigation or adaptation objectives. In discussions with member countries of the LAC Circular Economy Coalition, a knowledge gap among local and national decision-makers in terms of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems in the circularity sector has been noted. The countries have also lamented the lack of knowledge exchange initiatives that would enable best practices to be shared among countries facing similar challenges. It is important to design an M&E system that captures best practices and collects and shares baselines that can feed into national, sub-national, and international reporting on climate change and sustainable development. M&E systems are also important in determining whether or not implemented measures are on track and how they can be improved.  
CTCN Support
The objective of this multi-country assistance is to propose guidelines for establishing systems by which to measure and evaluate the impact of circular economy actions on national climate objectives. Recommendations will be compiled so that each country, based on its own priorities, strategies and actions, as well as the status of its information and reporting systems, can build and/or improve its M&E system of the portfolio of circular initiatives. The assistance will contribute common concepts, a generic matrix of indicators, and good practices for data collection, indicator estimation, updating and analysis.
Expected Impact
The expected impact of the assistance will be to provide each participating country with technical guidelines with which to consolidate an M&E system for measures aimed at a circular economy, including their impact on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The M&E system established by each country will enable tracking, monitoring of effectiveness, and identification of possible improvements. This technical assistance will also include a gender perspective in identifying indicators of adaptation and resilience to climate change, and in the search for a gender balance in the working group and capacity building activities.

Coral reefs are central to the economy and livelihoods of Palau while providing risk reduction benefits. However, climate change is posing a serious threat to the survival of corals. Rise in sea surface temperature and ocean acidification as a result of climate change is causing more frequent and severe coral bleaching events. Future projections also indicate that widespread coral bleaching will occur annually in Palau’s coral reefs by 2040. 
To address these challenges, Palau has established marine protected areas along the coast to conserve coral reefs under the Palau Protected Areas Act (2003), which provides the overall framework to protect corals. Yet most corals are unable to cope with rising sea surface temperatures, which can increase the frequency of bleaching events. And conventional coral reef restoration technologies such as direct transplantation have low coral survival rates of 64% and may damage the existing environment. Thus, heat-tolerant corals can be introduced to restore damaged coral reefs as well as build resilience to climate change impacts.
This technical assistance will support the deployment of heat-tolerant corals in Palau to address rising sea surface temperature and assist in building community resilience to climate change. It will also provide capacity building for Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC) and involve local communities as well as NGOs throughout the process since coral reef restoration technology is still an emerging technology in Palau.

The technical assistance is expected to strengthen the capacity of Palau´s local stakeholders to manage and outplant heat-tolerant corals. It will also improve the lack of knowledge and understanding of coral reef restoration technology by the community. In the long run, climate financing may be leveraged to scale the technology in Palau and other Pacific Islands, with PICRC as one of the leading institutions implementing restoration activities in the Pacific.

Hydrogen, with its high energy density under certain conditions, is an energy carrier that is suitable for storage applications such as batteries. Currently, green hydrogen is not explicitly integrated into Mongolia's domestic energy or climate policy framework. In order to deploy it more broadly, several issues such as production costs and infrastructure development still need to be addressed. It is necessary to secure sufficient renewable energy for hydrogen production, and to select and install appropriate electrolyzers based on both the amount of hydrogen demand and the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The cost of electrolysis equipment to be installed is also a concern. Regarding transportation of green hydrogen, if the hydrogen production and demand areas are far apart, it is necessary to consider whether to liquefy the hydrogen or to convert it into other carrier compound such as ammonia or MCH4. For utilization, it is necessary to consider the appropriate technical method for cogeneration of heat and power by green hydrogen (or conversion to fuel cells, etc.), taking into account the off-taker demand and the above considerations for production and transportation.
CTCN Support
A feasibility study will be undertaken to assess green hydrogen production possibilities using electricity from renewable energy farms already in operation in Mongolia, to be transferred and used for hydrogen fueled gas turbine for cogeneration of heat and power supply.  An additional study will be conducted to identify the necessary permits and funding possibilities. The following activities will be implemented: 1) Survey on green hydrogen production. Investigation of the amount of renewable energy that can be utilized, comparison of electrolyzers, and study on water resources and adaptation measures. 2) Survey on green hydrogen transportation. Investigation and selection of the optimal method of transportation and storage facilities. 3) Survey on green hydrogen utilization. Investigation of energy demand by the off-takers (hydrogen customers), study of heat and power supply system using green hydrogen.
Expected Impact
If Mongolia's high renewable energy potential can be utilized to produce green hydrogen, GHG and air pollutant emissions from coal combustion can be completely eliminated within the target area. Production of green hydrogen using excess renewable energy will function as a storage battery, contributing to resolve the instability in the power system in Mongolia caused by the massive introduction of renewable energies since 2013. Enhancing energy storage capacity will also increase the amount of renewable energy that can be connected to the Mongolian power grid. If combined heat and power generation technology using green hydrogen can be deployed in Ulaanbaatar, up to 1.64 million people could benefit. The technical assistance will contribute to Mongolia's NDC, which targets a GHG reduction of 22.7% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels, and which calls for increasing domestic solar power generation to 145 MW by 2030, wind power to 354 MW, and the share of renewable energy to 30%.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

In Liberia, the energy sector is the largest contributor to GHG emissions, accounting for over 67% of national emissions primarily due to the intensive use of gasoline and diesel in power generation. Liberia’s NDC aims to render Liberia carbon neutral by 2050 and also lays out a scenario of increasing the share of renewable electricity in the country to 30% by 2030. The country needs to attract national and international investments in renewable electricity to achieve these NDC commitments, and estimates that a total of 100 MW of renewable energy generation (solar, biomass and small hydro) and investments of about USD 242 million will need to be made by independent Power Producers (IPP). Liberia has not yet been successful in attracting private IPP investments to achieve the renewable energy IPP programme because of the absence of the necessary regulatory and policy framework and associated institutional capacity, the lack of an appropriate de-risking mechanism, and the absence of a paradigm shifting pipeline development.
CTCN Support
The central aim is to put in place the much needed policy, regulatory, and investment frameworks, and procedures to implement the renewable IPP programme and to carry out the necessary steps to develop a transformative project concept note in partnership with an accredited entity. This technical assistance will establish an investment framework for renewable energy, implement a de-risking mechanism, and develop and submit a high-quality Project Concept Note to GCF. 
Expected Impact
This readiness support will contribute to national climate change strategies, the National Rural Energy Master Plan, the Liberian Agenda for Transformation 2030, and achievement of the country's NDC. The impacts of the readiness support will be evidenced by the subsequent availability of GCF support for a renewable energy project in Liberia. The impacts will also be measurable in 2030 as the share of renewable electricity in the Liberian electrical system that can be attributed to this readiness support. The beneficiaries are the Rural and Renewable Energy Agency, Liberia Electricity Regulatory Commission, Liberia Electricity Corporation, public and private renewable energy investors and banking and financial institutions. A significant share of the 79% of the population which does not currently have access to electricity will also benefit from electricity access as a result of increased renewable electricity capacity additions coupled with electrification efforts.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

Thailand recently announced its goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2065. Green hydrogen has great potential to support achieving the net-zero goal while also creating economic activities. Commercial hydrogen producers in Thailand are still limited, and currently most production is grey hydrogen with gas pipeline, tube trailer, and cylinders/cylinders pack as mode of transportation. Thailand will be able to use a wide variety of bio resources as fuels, such as bioethanol and biogas. With the available infrastructure, these resources could have the potential to enable large-scale hydrogen production in Thailand. 
However, the development of green hydrogen thus far has been slow and would need to accelerate to serve the net-zero goal. Thailand has still not formulated its national strategies on hydrogen development and needs closer collaboration between ministry policymakers, academics, and the private sector, along with expertise to properly assess the potential use of green hydrogen and its social, economic and GHG emission reduction impacts, as well as suitable production technologies and transportation modes. A masterplan on large-scale implementation of demonstration projects could initiate rapid development of green hydrogen technologies and attract further funding needed for later stages of development. The country has requested technical assistance from the CTCN to develop national strategies on green hydrogen, and to seek additional assistance on pilot demonstration projects along with possible funding support from the Green Climate Fund in the future.
CTCN Support
The objective is to provide a clear strategy to utilize green hydrogen technologies to achieve Thailand’s net-zero goal. The strategy, or so-called masterplan, should serve as a map for a more detailed and actionable plan for the government to develop a regulatory framework, infrastructures and policies to support the development of green hydrogen technologies and to help relevant stakeholders understand their roles during the development stage and future commercial stages. The technical assistance will include an assessment of potential uses for green hydrogen in the energy, transport, commercial and industrial sectors, and the identification of the three most suitable application areas; identification of suitable technological options to produce and transport hydrogen alongside qualitative and quantitative resource requirements; development of a national vision paper; national action plans and technology roadmaps for the implementation of the two most suitable application areas and technologies; identification of resources and expertise required for pilot scale implementation of roadmaps; capacity building for national policymakers, and business matchmaking forums and private sector engagement for the purpose of technology transfer. 
Expected Impact
This technical assistance will enhance economic activities, especially in the mobility and automotive sectors, given that green hydrogen and other related clean technologies might be the new growth driving factors in Thailand. Additionally, the agriculture sector, which contains large rural households, could benefit from green hydrogen produced using bio resource technologies. The assistance also contributed to achieving the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution, which aims to reduce GHG emissions by 20% from the projected business-as-usual level by 2030. To achieve carbon neutrality by 2065, Thailand emphasizes the importance of innovation and R&D, especially in the areas of low carbon electricity generation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), bioenergy with CCS, and hydrogen economy.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, where the impacts are already being experienced, including persistent hot weather, heavy rains, land degradation, particularly through erosions, longer dry seasons, increased drought sequences during rainy seasons, and flooding. Climate projections in the DRC over the coming decades predict an increase in temperatures of 3ºC to 5ºC, a decrease in rainfall and an increase in its variability, as well as an increase in extreme events. These climate variations will have a significant impact on the country's main climate-sensitive economic sectors.
CTCN Support
The country has requested technical assistance from the CTCN to produce a roadmap focusing on a specific climate technology prioritized by stakeholders in order to identify actions for the deployment of its incubator on a large scale in the DRC. This will include an analysis of the updated Nationally Determined Contribution and other strategic documents; the engagement of stakeholders to present a list of technologies with the aim of choosing one; development of a technology roadmap containing the following elements: technology potential, performance, costs, impacts, economic barriers, financial and market elements, and the link with public laws and policies, as well as recommendations for the use and deployment of its incubator on a large scale. 
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will contribute to GHG emissions reductions in the DRC, and provide opportunities for capacity building and skills transfer, improved living conditions, job creation, enhanced economic profitability, and diversification of the economy. The assistance will also advance progress toward meeting the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution, in which the DRC has targeted an overall 21% GHG emissions reduction, and has committed to formalize the institutional arrangements that support the collection, analysis, processing, and reporting on mitigation measures and efforts to explore the associated co-benefits, as well as reporting on indicators related to adaptation.",,,"Decent work and economic growth, Climate action",

Greater Dhaka is home to 17 million people and has been experiencing rapid urbanization since its independence in 1971. The population is expected to rise to by roughly 25 million by 2025. With a rising population alongside economic growth, the GHG emissions from the transport sector have been steadily increasing since 2005. 
Around 70% of emissions from the transport sector come from roads, as the major modes of transport in Dhaka City are motorcycles (41%), rickshaws, and public buses. For people living in the city, buses and minibuses are the cheapest options. However, user satisfaction has been low due to long waiting and loading times, and distances from residences to bus stops. Therefore, existing urban transport system poses many challenges to daily commuters due to operational inefficiency, increased costs, loss of time, and air pollution. 
It’s estimated that mitigation action in the transport sector would contribute to a 9.3% reduction in GHG emissions nationally by 2030, or up to 27% if additional support were to be received from developed countries. Bangladesh has planned to improve fuel efficiency by 5% unconditionally with an additional 15% conditional upon international support, bolstered by the improvement of road traffic congestion issues. 
The Government of Bangladesh requested technical assistance from the CTCN to develop a framework for real-time transport information systems in greater Dhaka. Implementation of GPS data monitoring for public transport would significantly increase service quality for customers and provide additional value to service providers. 
CTCN Support
The objective is to develop a framework for Real-Time Transport Information Systems for public transport in the Greater Dhaka area to ensure better performance and enhance reliability, safety, and service. The envisaged scope of work includes:
 1. Establishing a baseline through collection of data and information 
2. Design of the overall system architecture 
3. Development of the information services architecture in detail 
4. Equipment, operations, and maintenance costs
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will optimize the use of public transport by providing real-time information on vehicle location, waiting time, and route information and ultimately contribute to a reduction in vehicle emissions and an improved and more accessible user experience. It will benefit women and children, who have faced increased levels of difficulty traveling via public transport to school and work. The technical assistance is aligned with Bangladesh’s Nationally Determined Contribution, which lists potential mitigation actions in the transport sector, including ‘introducing intelligent transport system based public transport management system to ensure better performance, enhance reliability, safety and service,’ and in its NDC implementation Roadmap (2018), support for ‘real-time information on public transport’ to help facilitate carbon reduction in the transport sector.

In Jakarta, there is still a lack of awareness of e-bus technology and its benefits. As a result, there are still limited policies covering the transition to electric mobility in Indonesia. The government does not have targets or road maps for e-bus deployment and has long used the same business model for public transport development. The fiscal incentives, procurement, and cost of charging infrastructure are still uncertain. Air pollution has worsened due to the continued use of fossil fuel for vehicles. Additionally, transport policies and infrastructure mostly have not provided for gender inclusiveness.
CTCN Support 
The initial implementation of e-bus infrastructure in Jakarta will be provided by Transjakarta, the regional-owned company which operates the largest bus rapid transit (BRT) system in the world. Transjakarta is implementing a pilot project of 100 e-buses and will later implement full electric bus fleets in 2030 as stated in their long-term plan. Although the deployment plan and pilot have been developed, several aspects are missing that would guide a step-by-step action plan to implement this procurement target. Therefore, CTCN technical assistance was requested to fill this gap by providing the roadmap and timetable of e-bus deployment with an intention to smooth its transition to the electrification program. The CTCN is working closely with relevant stakeholders in e-mobility ecosystems to prepare a list of recommendations to accelerate the large scale e-bus deployment for Transjakarta’s BRT and Non-BRT services, including a list of policy recommendations, pilot project evaluation matrix, charging strategy and operational plan, road map of implementation, investment plan and business model, GHG reduction assessment, assessment on renewable energy adoption, and grid assessment.
Expected Impact
The recommendations from this TA can be used by Transjakarta as guidance for implementing large scale e-bus deployment. The estimated GHG emissions reductions will support the government in justifying the plan to reduce emissions through the use of electric vehicles in the transport sector. Electric vehicles can reduce air pollution and bring public health benefits. The technical assistance will ensure that accessibility, safety, and labor provisions have been considered, especially for women, children, and people with disabilities. The outputs can also be adopted in other cities seeking to deploy electric buses for their urban transport services. The technical assistance is contributing to the achievement of Indonesia’s NDC, which has an unconditional GHG emissions reduction target of 29% and a conditional 41% reduction by 2030 compared to business-as-usual, to be implemented through five sources of emissions, namely energy, which includes the transport sector.","United Nations Environment Programme","United Nations Environment Programme","Gender equality, Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

Pakistan is one of the lowest contributors to global climate change but has consistently ranked in the top ten most vulnerable countries to it. In Pakistan, climate change impacts labour productivity and sustainable livelihoods. Climatic events trigger human displacement, negatively impact the health of the population, and affect economic growth. 
With the rising population, economic growth, and changing patterns of consumption, the country is experiencing increased energy demand alongside a rise in GHG emissions from the energy sector. Here, women are more affected as a result of numerous barriers to economic advancement as well as exclusion from climate change decision-making and planning. One way to curtail these impacts is to transition toward a green economy model, which is linked strongly with new forms of employment in sectors based on sustainable resource management. Green jobs are those that contribute to environmental sustainability. Specifically, this includes jobs that help to protect ecosystems and biodiversity, reduce energy and water consumption through high efficiency strategies, and minimize or altogether avoid generation of all forms of waste and pollution. 
With respect to women, Pakistan ranked 151 out of 153 countries on the Global Gender Gap Index Report 2020, with its Human Development Index 25% lower for women compared to men. Although gender is prioritised in the National Policy for Development and Empowerment of Women (2002), Gender Reform Action Plan (2005), and Vision 2025, significant gaps persist in Pakistan’s SDG National Framework, including a lack of baseline data, clear intervention targets, and attention to intersections between SDG5 (gender equality) and SDG7 (energy access).
CTCN Support
The overall objective of the technical assistance is to encourage green entrepreneurial spirit in Pakistan, with a specific focus on clean and renewable energy and its potential co-benefits with an emphasis on gender. This will involve capacity building, formulating course outlines on how green entrepreneurship can be successful, and training youth and educating them about the green economy across clean energy, tourism, and disaster mitigation mechanisms. This will require trainer recruitment, capacity building mechanisms, and a technological reporting mechanism that will allow the Ministry of Climate Change to track developments of this initiative and allow it to build and increase scalability. This request is for collaboration between CTCN (for mainstreaming climate resilience) and Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change.
There will be between 6 and 7 sites identified (one site in each province and associated areas in Pakistan) where the following activities will be implemented: gender inclusive policy support and development; a review of energy relevant policies; capacity building and gender audits in the energy sector; knowledge management, awareness and advocacy; investment promotion and business development; and the development of gender-responsive project screening tools including a technological reporting mechanism, similar to a dashboard, that the Ministry of Climate Change and relevant ministries will have access to. This will include the design of a monitoring and reporting framework with baseline established focused on gender mainstreaming in the energy sector, or even more focused on the textile sector.
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will contribute to changing expectations around gender roles and responsibilities, enabling access to greater resources through information sharing and skills training; additional fora to ensure the practical and strategic needs of women are voiced and increased women’s public sector participation in energy-related technical fields and decision-making positions; ensuring that all energy policies, programmes and initiatives are non-discriminatory, gender-inclusive, gender-balanced and directed towards addressing inequalities, particularly energy poverty, differentially affecting men and women in the region; determining the right scale and scope of intervention through gender disaggregated data on energy access in energy provision programmes and processes to target urban/rural women’s specific energy needs; developing appropriate M&E techniques for culturally sensitive modes of data collection; designing, targeting and implementing interventions that are gender-sensitive; tailoring community-based energy solutions, enabling ministries of energy and electric utilities to partner with local small and medium energy enterprises and NGOs to work with off-grid communities. ",,,"Gender equality, Climate action",

Sri Lanka has one of the lowest per capita carbon emissions rates for a lower middle-income country. However, during the past decade progress along the low-carbon growth trajectory has been threatened by several policy and institutional issues across sectors, even as the importance of sustainability has emerged in regional and global spheres. Over the last two decades, Sri Lanka's active vehicle fleet has increased dramatically due to rising numbers of personal vehicles with only a fraction of an increase in use of public transport modes, a trend which is expected to continue in coming years. GHG emissions from the transport sector have increased at a faster rate than any other energy sector, contributing 10 Gt CO2e out of a total of 24 Gt CO2e per annum. In the country, fuel consumed by the transport sector contributes to 70% of the total demand for petroleum. The absence of a policy framework for a sustainable transport system has impeded the formulation of strategies for systematic integration of sustainable transport concepts into the national transport system, despite an ambitious NDC update in 2021. Other challenges are related to information management, appraisal methods/tools, actor competencies, technology transfer, social inclusion, stakeholder engagement, and sustainable financing. 
CTCN Support
The objective of the technical assistance is to facilitate the introduction of e-buses to the public transport system in Sri Lanka using effective technology transfer and adoption. The activities to be included are: conducting a comprehensive characterization of technologies; developing an education and training package for competency building; formulating a framework and protocol for e-bus project appraisal; and operationalizing an information management platform for the e-bus fleet.
Expected Impact
This technical assistance will also focus on the ways in which women face more numerous mobility barriers than men, and the need to include their voices in transport design, planning, and operations. Urban biodiversity will also be taken into account with regard to minimizing accidents that take place in urban wildlife corridors. The elderly, women, children, and people with disabilities will be actively engaged in education and professional development in e-bus integration into the public transport system and in the comprehensive framework and protocol for appraisals of e-bus projects. Likewise, the information management platform for the e-bus fleet will have a section for these populations, and for biodiversity, environmental values, and other co-benefits.
The technical assistance will also contribute to the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution, in which the transport sector is one of six mitigation sectors covered in the updated NDCs, where it is stated that the country plans to promote public passenger transport, introduce taxes and other instruments for its promotion, promote electric mobility and hybrid vehicles, and improve vehicle fleet efficiency.",,,"Gender equality, Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

In Pakistan, the transport sector is responsible for a large share of emissions and worsening air pollution. Road transport is dominant and responsible for carrying 91% of national passenger traffic and 96% of freight. As the population and economy have grown, the number of vehicles on the road has drastically increased. It is important for the country to seize an opportunity to transition to electric mobility. It has set targets to replace 30% of fossil fuel vehicles with electric vehicles, 3000 CNG stations to be converted to charging stations, and 100,000 cars and 500,000 bikes and rickshaws to be converted to EVs during the next four years. To achieve this target, Pakistan will launch the National Electric Vehicle Policy to introduce supporting mechanisms designed to increased electric vehicle penetration. The country also plans to conduct a market assessment to identify various gaps and barriers and ultimately to create a concrete roadmap. 
CTCN Support
Pakistan has requested technical assistance from the CTCN to prepare a funding proposal to support preparatory activities to deploy and scale up electric vehicle use in the country. The proposal will cover the market readiness assessment, implementation roadmap with suitable business models and investment plans, detailed feasibility study for the selected interventions, and capacity development for the relevant stakeholders.
Expected Impact
A disruptive market transition to electric vehicles presents an opportunity to address unequal representation of women in decision-making and to increase women’s participation in the transport sector by providing socio-economic opportunities in new business models as drivers, charging solution providers, and fleet operators. The electric vehicle transition will also lessen air pollution, thereby improving public health.

Vientiane is the capital city of the Lao PDR, which is projected to grow to over 1.4 million by 2030. Tourism to Lao PDR has been increasing significantly in recent years (with nearly 5 million overseas arrivals in 2015). As the population increases and tourists arrive in the capital, so does the demand for transport. Currently, fossil-fuel based private transportation options including privately owned cars, motorcycles, and publicly accessible tuk-tuks, songthaews, and taxis have been filling the gap. The existing public transport (bus-based) network is insufficient for the needs of the city. Therefore, investment in a better public transport network, including with so-called smart public transport, is needed. As such, Lao PDR has requested technical assistance to develop plans and pre-feasibility studies to improve the urban public transport network is Vientiane. The TA also requests capacity building, including the development of an administrative plan for aspects of urban public transport in Vientiane.
CTCN Support
The technical assistance will provide the additional capacity enhancement to Laos and Vientiane to develop and operate a public transport system. It will develop a detailed plan for the urban public transport system & network, a draft implementation plan for one possible Vientiane urban public transport system, a rough estimated cost calculation, and a draft institutional arrangement plan for operating and administrating the public transport network & system.
Expected Impact
The technical assistance will enable Lao PDR to better understand the future needs of Vientiane and its transport network and to create more detailed plans, funding applications, and budgets for projects and policies related to the urban public transport network. Eventually, if funding and approval for the projects and policies identified are obtained, project implementation will lead to an improved public transport network and a corresponding shift from other fossil-fuel-based modes, rendering a reduction in GHG emissions from transport in the country. The technical assistance will contribute to achieving Lao PDR’s Nationally Determined Contribution, which for the transportation sector aims at an average reduction of 25 to 300 kt CO2e/year between 2020 and 2030.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",

Pakistan’s energy sector contribution to GHG emissions has remained historically high with an estimated 2018 contribution of 44%. The construction sector is highly energy and carbon-intensive, currently producing between 25% and 40% of global carbon emissions. Around 8% of the overall global CO2 emissions come from the production of steel and concrete. Due to a lack of green building standards and regulations, rapid urbanization taking place across Pakistan has spurred infrastructural development that is not environmentally sustainable. Green building standards along with a clear methodology, monitoring verification and enhancement (MV&E), and financing are needed. 
Pakistan has been constrained by both limited access to financing and a lack of public awareness regarding the importance of adopting green building practices.

This technical assistance aims to introduce green building standards, including a baseline assessment of current infrastructure (including commercial, office and residential buildings), as well as the development of standards for new green building infrastructure and the conversion of existing infrastructure to net zero buildings.
Expected Impact
The technical assistance aims to tackle the challenge of increasing energy demand and inefficient energy consumption of buildings through the introduction of green building standards for new buildings and building retrofits. Over time, this will promote energy efficiency and renewable energy in the building sector, thus contributing to realizing the country’s energy efficiency potential. The technical assistance will also benefit women, who will gain further access to a more reliable energy supply, capacity building and training in the construction sector, and business opportunities in the buildings and construction sector. The technical assistance contributes to Pakistan’s 2021 Nationally Determined Contribution, which prioritizes energy demand and supply management, and engagement of the private sector as key mitigation priorities, and targets specific actions including green building codes and certification for new and refurbished buildings.",,,"Affordable and clean energy, Climate action",
