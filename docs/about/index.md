# About the Handbook

![Offshore Wind Farm](../img/offshore-wind-farm.jpg)

The climate tech movement is **exploding**.

Every day there is news about which technologies are succeeding, which are failing, and the best ways to make an impact.

**Job seekers** and career changers need experience.

**Investors** need confidence and risk management.


## Our Mission

## Our Vision

The Climate Tech Handbook is here to serve:

1. [Job seekers](../career-guide) in Climate Tech

2. Startup founders and leaders

3. Investors
