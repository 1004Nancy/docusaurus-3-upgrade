## Sector Overview

In the last 5 years, there has been a lot of progress made in developing transportation to reverse climate change. Some of this progress includes the development of more fuel-efficient vehicles, the use of alternative fuels, and the expansion of public transit systems.

Fuel-efficient vehicles:

One of the most important ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation is to use more fuel-efficient vehicles. In the last 5 years, there have been significant improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency. For example, the average fuel economy of new cars and trucks in the United States has increased from 24.1 miles per gallon in 2011 to 29.1 miles per gallon in 2019. This is a significant increase that will help to reduce emissions from transportation.

Alternative fuels:

Another important way to reduce emissions from transportation is to use alternative fuels. In the last 5 years, there has been a lot of progress made in the development of alternative fuels. For example, there has been a significant increase in the use of electric vehicles. In 2015, there were about 400,000 electric vehicles on the road in the United States. By 2019, this number had increased to over 2 million. The use of electric vehicles is important because they produce zero emissions.

Public transit:

Another way to reduce emissions from transportation is to use public transit. In the last 5 years, there has been a lot of progress made in the expansion of public transit systems. For example, in the United States, the number of people taking public transit has increased from 10.7 billion rides in 2014 to 11.5 billion rides in 2019. This is a significant increase that will help to reduce emissions from transportation.
