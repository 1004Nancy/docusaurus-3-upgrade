## Definition of LEVEL 0

:::info Level 0
**Stay here if you**:

- Know very little about what "[climate tech](#what-is-climate-tech)" means

- Need to brush up on [fundamental climate knowledge](#fundamental-climate-knowledge)

- Want to understand [what a climate job is like](#what-is-a-climate-job-like)

- Have never heard of the Project Drawdown [Solution Framework](#project-drawdown-solution-frameworks) or the [Speed and Scale](#speed-and-scale) Framework

- Are not yet a member and would like to learn more about these 3 [core communities](#core-communities):
	- The Handbook Slack Community
	- Work on Climate
	- MCJ Collective

## Lesson Start

![test](../static/img/welcome-aboard.jpg) 

Congratulations! You took the first step.

:::note Lesson 1
### In this lesson:
- What is "climate tech"
- Intro to Climate Solution frameworks
- What a climate job is like
- Intro to core communities and resources
:::

## What is Climate Tech?

There is both a **broad definition**, 

as well as a Silicon Valley style **industry definition**.

:::book a broad definition
Any form of technology that will help us implement our climate goals, particularly the 1.5C goal which requires:

- 50% emission reduction by 2030
- Net zero emissions by 2050.
:::

#### A Silicon Valley style industry definition:

:::book rough industry definition:

A recent financial movement to invest in startups that are focused on a particular solution to the climate emergency.
:::book
#### Climate tech vs Clean tech:

First - **fixing climate is a subset** within a broader circle of clean technologies.

For example, water pollution, plastic pollution, or e-waste do not cause greenhouse emissions. However, they are still a critical problem affecting environmental health, justice, and the biodiversity crisis.

Second - **clean tech has an association** with a green startup period during the Obama administraton. 

Experiments from that time didn't quite turn out as expected.

Climate tech can be seen version 2.0 [renaissance] for the 2020s.

## What is a climate job like?

:::question Frequently Asked Questions
- [How well does it pay?](#how-well-does-it-pay)

- [How do I learn the necessary skills?](#how-do-i-learn-the-necessary-skills)

- [How secure are these jobs?](#how-secure-are-these-jobs)

- [How much do I need to know about climate science and politics?](#how-much-do-i-need-to-know-about-climate-science-and-politics)

- [How do I avoid greenwashing?](#how-do-i-avoid-greenwashing)

<!--questions about IT tech, deep tech, hard tech, and trade work-->

:::
### How well does it pay?

#### Early stage startups:

You will be dealing with a lot of early stage startups.

Roughly 3,000+ companies / organizations exist in our current database.

:::note Most often
- **Early stage startups tend to pay lower salaries** in exchange for generous equity packages.

- **That said, climate startups want to attract quality talent** and hopefully understand that competitive pay is important.
:::

#### Established companies:

:::note another option
Change the direction of your current company.

Or try to steer a bigger company that's been around for a while.

- --Project Drawdown has a [guide on this topic](park) / [Workforclimate.org](
https://www.workforclimate.org/)

- Companies like Microsoft, Google, Stripe, etc. have a specific corporate 
sustainability positions. There are also many consultancies.

- Think outside the box. For example, you are in procurement, you have a 
huge opportunity to order supplies that come from clean sources. Start a green team that doesn't exist in your current job
:::

#### Don't forget Government Jobs:

:::note Government Jobs
There are plenty of government jobs <!--governmentjobs.com example urls-->

- The salaries are lower, but some states and counties <!--munis??--> offer good health care and pensions

- There can be a higher level of job security, predictability, and transparency compared to a fast moving startup environment.

- Policy and academic roles are valuable as well (for example, analyzing the impact of voluntary carbon markets)

###  How do I learn the necessary skills?

There are two aspects:

1. **Marketable skills**

2. **Domain knowledge**

Marketable Skills:

:::note 3+ years of tech experience
#### If you already have marketable skills and tech experience

There are [plenty of jobs](https://climatetechlist.com) that have the same roles as a non-climate tech company

:::

What if you don't have tech experience?

:::info Experience gap
#### If you are new to tech without 3+ years of experience

[You can contribute](contribute) to the Handbook as an open source project to gain experience quickly
:::

Next is domain knowledge.

:::tip Domain knowledge
#### You're in the right place!

- We built the Handbook to gather the best information on [all 93 Climate Solutions](solutions) from Project Drawdown

- Writing is learning. [Contribute to the Handbook](contribute) and become an expert
:::
---

###  How secure are these jobs?

- **It varies by job category** - [Startup](early-stage-startups) vs [Established company](#established-companies) vs [Government](#dont-forget-government-jobs)

- **It varies by climate solution** - some solutions are better established and others are very early.

**For example:**

- The highest anticipated growth is in automotive, power generation, and electrical efficiency (_[Electricity Sector](electricity)_).  <!--citation. MCJ Podcast??-->

- Voluntary Carbon Markets started as a popular solution, but have recently been hit by a round of layoffs, due to public criticism on overstated benefits

As we [continue writing the Handbook together](contribute), we will better be tracking news on [Solution](solutions) viability in the marketplace.

---

###  How do I avoid greenwashing?

- Read and support journalism outlets such as [DeSmog](https://www.desmog.com//), [Grist](grist.org), [Inside Climate News](https://insideclimatenews.org/), [Climate Desk](climatedesk.org), and more.
<!--Link to Resources, and Media Sector-->
- This is a big topic and we are working on a guide

- [Tell us your findings on Slack](contribute) and we'll report on it

---

### How much do I need to know about climate science and politics?

- It depends on the [Solution](solution). The [electrical](sector-electricity) grid can get quite complicated. Others less so.

- It depends on the role. Being a software engineer or running people operations are more transferrable. If you are in sales or marketing, you need to know as much as possible about your industry market.

- Our goal is to document --x together

## Fundamental Climate Knowledge

:::info If you already know this
Skip to:
- [Solution Frameworks](#solution-frameworks)
- [Core Communities](#core-communities)
- [Skill Requirements](#skill-requirements)
:::
###

#### The 2015 Paris Agreement

- Signed by --xx countries, except -xx
- All agreed to prevent the global average temperature from rising more than 1.5 Celsius

Key Points:


#### Our carbon budget
#### 1.5 degrees vs and 2 degrees celsius

Common myths:

- Temperature doesn't go down!
