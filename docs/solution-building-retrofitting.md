## Overview

Building retrofitting involves enhancing existing buildings to be more energy-efficient and reduce their carbon impact, achieved through methods such as insulation, energy-efficient windows, and upgraded heating/cooling systems. Technological advances, such as energy-efficient windows and aerogel insulation, have driven progress in this field. Notable contributors include Johnson Controls and the U.S. Green Building Council.

## Progress Made

- Thermal insulation, energy-efficient windows, and green roofs

- Organizations like the International Energy Agency, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the UK's Carbon Trust have been pivotal.

## Lessons Learned

Key insights from the development and implementation of Building Retrofitting to reverse climate change include:

1. **Comprehensive Planning**: An all-encompassing plan is essential, aiming for optimal energy efficiency and carbon reduction while minimizing expenses.
2. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involving all parties, from building owners to government officials, is crucial during planning and execution.
3. **Financing Variety**: Exploring diverse financing options, such as private investment, government incentives, and utility rebates, can make retrofitting more affordable.
4. **Holistic Approach**: The most successful retrofitting projects address both physical and operational aspects of buildings.
5. **Part of Broader Effort**: Retrofitting's impact in reducing emissions is significant but must align with broader decarbonization strategies.

Leading organizations in this arena include the International Energy Agency (IEA), International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC), and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

## Challenges Ahead

Major challenges remaining in Building Retrofitting for climate change reversal are:

1. **High Costs**: The substantial expenses associated with retrofit projects often discourage adoption, especially for residential properties and smaller businesses.
2. **Awareness Gap**: Lack of awareness about retrofitting's benefits hinders its widespread adoption.
3. **Skilled Personnel**: A shortage of trained professionals qualified for retrofitting projects can lead to suboptimal results.

Prominent contributors to the Building Retrofitting movement are the U.S. Department of Energy, Johnson Controls, Honeywell, and Siemens. These entities have been instrumental in advancing retrofit technology and systems.

## Best Path Forward

While the optimal path forward for Building Retrofitting may vary based on community specifics, some general best practices include:

1. **Clear Goals**: Set clear retrofitting goals aligned with climate change mitigation objectives.
2. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Engage building owners, occupants, and local government in the planning and design phases.
3. **Comprehensive Audit**: Conduct an energy audit to identify potential retrofit measures.
4. **Appropriate Measures**: Select retrofit actions suitable for the building and climate, prioritizing energy savings and emission reductions.
5. **Phased Implementation**: Gradually implement retrofit measures, starting with cost-effective options.
6. **Evaluation and Sharing**: Continuously monitor results and share insights to aid other communities.

Leading organizations in this endeavor include the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Building Decarbonization Coalition, offering resources and research to guide successful retrofit projects.
