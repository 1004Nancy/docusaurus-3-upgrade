## Overview

Animal agriculture makes up nearly [15% of human-caused global greenhouse-gas emissions](https://www.fao.org/news/story/en/item/197623/icode/). A growing number of companies are working to bring alternatives to market that have the potential to cut emissions.

## Progress Made

- We now have popular meat alternatives on the market such as: Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat 
- Government regulators have now given the green light for lab grown meat. Two companies approved are [Upside Foods](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/history-made-upside-foods-is-approved-to-sell-cultivated-meat-in-the-us-following-completion-of-final-usda-regulatory-step-301857015.html) and [Eat Just](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230621583158/en/GOOD-Meat-Gets-Full-Approval-in-the-U.S.-for-Cultivated-Meat)
 

## Lessons Learned

Some of the key lessons that have been learned in the development and implementation of Plant-Rich Diets to reverse climate change are as follows: 

1. There is a need for more awareness and education on the topic in order to engage more people in plant-based diets.
2. There is a need for more research and development in the area in order to improve plant-based diets and make them more accessible to people.
3. There is a need for more government support in the form of policies and regulations that encourage plant-based diets.

Some of the companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of this solution are Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and the Plant Based Foods Association.

## Challenges Ahead

There are a number of challenges that remain in the development and implementation of Plant-Rich Diets to reverse climate change. One of the major challenges is the need to increase the production of plant-based foods. This can be done through a variety of methods, including increasing the amount of land devoted to growing crops, improving yields, and developing new plant-based foods.

Another challenge is to change the way that people consume food. This includes changing dietary habits and food preferences, as well as increasing the availability of plant-based foods. Additionally, it is important to educate people about the benefits of plant-based diets and the dangers of climate change.

Finally, there is a need to develop policies and regulations that support the adoption of plant-based diets. This includes creating incentives for farmers to grow crops, investing in research and development, and enacting laws and regulations that support the production and consumption of plant-based foods.

A number of companies and organizations have been at the forefront of developing and promoting plant-based diets. These include PlantPure, The Good Food Institute, Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, and Hampton Creek. Additionally, a number of celebrities, including James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ellen DeGeneres, have publicly promoted plant-based diets.

## Best Path Forward

There is not a single answer to this question as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Plant-Rich Diets to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change will vary depending on the geographical location and the resources available. However, some general steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of plant-based diets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Providing incentives for people to adopt plant-based diets, such as tax breaks or subsidies for plant-based foods.
3. Working with the food industry to develop more plant-based products that are affordable and accessible to consumers.
4. Supporting research and development of plant-based meat and dairy products.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of promoting plant-based diets include Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, the Good Food Institute, and Plant Based Foods Association.
