## Overview

Adopting a plant-rich diet is the most impactful food-related change we can make, according to research by the US Department of Agriculture. By reducing worldwide cattle numbers, we can achieve immediate climate gains due to methane's short half-life. A study analyzing emissions from US cattle found that beef production contributes just [3.3%](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/03/five-beef-industry-myths-busted) of the nation's overall climate footprint. Shifting towards plant-based diets offers the greatest potential for positive impact, surpassing increased yields, agricultural efficiency, and reduced food waste. Embracing plant-rich diets and reducing beef consumption can significantly mitigate environmental impact and address climate change.

Food design technologies are revolutionizing plant-based options, enhancing taste and aroma. Advancements like extrudable fat technology, introducing new food resources, and climate-first supply chain technologies are transforming the way we eat. Embracing these innovations allows us to make sustainable choices for a healthier future.

Here are the [latest technology](https://gfi.org/science/the-science-of-plant-based-meat/) developments:

* Lab-grown meat (CBM): Stem cells from animal biopsy are grown in bioreactors to form muscle, fat, and connective tissue for meat production.
* Plant- and fungi-based meat (PBM): Plant ingredients undergo sourcing, processing, and formulation stages to replace functional components in animal products through R&D.
* Recreate products have a low background flavor: The goal is to maintain a low background flavor in products without overpowering the subtler tastes of conventional meat or seafood.

## Key Players

Here is a list of 10 prominent players in the plant-based meat market:

1. Beyond Meat
2. Impossible Foods Inc.
3. Morningstar Farms
4. Quorn Foods
5. Lightlife Foods, Inc.
6. Tofurky
7. Amy's Kitchen, Inc.
8. Dr. Praeger's Sensible Foods
9. Trader Joe's
10. Yves Veggie Cuisine (The Hain-Celestial Canada, ULC)

## Lessons Learned

* Plant-based non-vegetarian alternatives market on the rise due to animal-borne infection risks, health concerns, and demand for good food commodities.
* Growing public understanding and demand for plant-based alternatives driven by health benefits and appeal to flexitarians.
* Increasing awareness of food system's climate impact influencing consumer purchasing decisions.
* [50%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of flexitarians interested in following food trends.
* [42%](https://www.unilever.com/news/news-search/2023/five-trends-that-will-take-plantbased-eating-mainstream-in-2023/) of consumers worldwide expect plant-based foods to replace meat in the next decade.

## Challenges Ahead

* Plant-based meat industry growth limited by population sensitivity to soy and gluten and high prices.
* Incorrect perception of taste of plant-based beef products can hinder market expansion.
* Plant-based meat is significantly more expensive than conventional meat on a per-pound basis, according to Nielsen data.
* [Analysts](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/business/beyond-meat-impossible-emissions.html) find it challenging to assess the sustainability of plant-based foods due to limited transparency regarding emissions.

## Best Path Forward

There is not a single answer to this question as the best path forward for the continued development and implementation of Plant-Rich Diets to effectively mitigate the effects of climate change will vary depending on the geographical location and the resources available. However, some general steps that need to be taken in order to ensure that this technology is adopted on a large scale and is effective include:

1. Increasing public awareness of the benefits of plant-based diets in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2. Providing incentives for people to adopt plant-based diets, such as tax breaks or subsidies for plant-based foods.
3. Working with the food industry to develop more plant-based products that are affordable and accessible to consumers.
4. Supporting research and development of plant-based meat and dairy products.

Some companies and organizations that have been at the forefront of promoting plant-based diets include Impossible Foods, Beyond Meat, the Good Food Institute, and Plant Based Foods Association.
