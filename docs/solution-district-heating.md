## Overview

* **District heating:** System distributing heat from central source to multiple buildings.
* **Heat sources:** Natural gas, oil, biomass, solar, geothermal.
* **Efficiency:** Can halve CO2 emissions compared to individual building boilers.
* **Key players:** International District Energy Association, District Energy in Buildings Initiative, Carbon Trust.

## Progress Made

* **Centralized heating:** Used in cold climates for efficiency.
* **Technological advances:** Development of high-temperature district heating up to 140Â°C.
* **Emission reduction:** New systems significantly lower greenhouse gases.
* **Key companies:** Aalborg Energie Technik, Danfoss, Eloq, Fortum, Siemens.

## Lessons Learned

* **Importance:** Emphasizes planning and stakeholder coordination.
* **Heat source challenges:** Reliability and maintenance of central boilers.
* **Infrastructure:** Needs strong network of pipes and pumps.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Investment:** Estimated $600-$900 billion needed globally over 20 years.
* **Awareness:** Limited knowledge about district heating technology.

## Best Path Forward

* **IEA's Role:** Significant role in climate change mitigation, aiming for one-third of world's heating by 2050.
* **Steps needed:** Raise awareness, government support, regulatory framework, and efficiency.
* **Key players:** IEA, District Heating and Cooling Association (DHCA), Climate Change and Industry Alliance (CCIA).
* **IEA reports:** Highlight past, present, and future of district heating.
