![Waste is mixed, combusted, and repeatedly turned for thorough burning. Fly ash and acidic gases are neutralized, metals extracted for recycling, and remaining ash used in construction. Steam powers a generator, with cooling steam reused or diverted for heating. Finally, activated carbon and ammonia injections remove heavy metals and neutralize nitrogen oxides, while high temperatures destroy dioxins and furans.](/../static/img/waste-to-energy.jpg)

## Overview

The progression in Waste to Energy (WtE) to counter climate change has been substantial. Innovations have led to efficient conversion of waste into energy, contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Leading this endeavor are entities like Waste to Energy Solutions, Inc. and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

## Progress Made

Waste to Energy (WtE) technology has rapidly advanced in the past decade, aided by breakthroughs such as plasma gasification and anaerobic digestion. Plasma gasification employs plasma torches to break down organic matter, generating gases for energy production. This technology is now operational in Europe and Asia, offering a potent tool against climate change. Anaerobic digestion, another promising approach, produces methane-rich biogas from organic matter without oxygen. This method is gaining traction in Europe and North America, showing potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from waste.

Companies pioneering WtE solutions:
- Hitachi Zosen Corporation
- SNC-Lavalin
- Waste Management, Inc.

## Lessons Learned

Key lessons from WtE development:
1. Early stages with challenges to address.
2. Successes and failures guide progress.
3. Learning from mistakes, pursuing successes.
4. Further technology refinement required.
5. Collaboration among numerous companies and organizations is paramount.

## Challenges Ahead

Challenges in WtE technology development:
- **High initial investment**: Overcoming financial barriers.
- **Resource supply**: Ensuring constant waste supply.
