#### Carbon Budget

??x Gigatons left for 1.5c scenario out of emission --{{get number}}

#### Carbon Class

Carbon accounting - Class 1, Class 2, Class 3 - based on operations vs supply chain etc.

#### Force Multiplier

#### Positive Feedback Loop

Not "positive" as in good. Positive as in rapid acceleration through a feedback loop. Examples:
1) The more ice that melts, the faster the remaining ice will melt.
2) The more permafrost we lose, the more methane is released, warming the planet faster
3) The more ice that melts, the less surface area there is to reflect the sun
4) The more coral reefs die and biodiversity loss occurs in the ocean (overfishing etc.), the less carbon absorption the ocean can provide

#### Project Drawdown

A collaboration of the best scientific researchers who devised a list of 93 climate solutions. According to founder Paul Hawken, these Drawdown solutions are the most viable and effective means available today to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Project Drawdown is a non-profit organization.  [projectdrawdown.org](https://projectdrawdown.org)
