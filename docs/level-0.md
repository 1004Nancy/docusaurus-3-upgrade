## ‚õ≥Ô∏è Start here

### Definition of LEVEL 0

**You**:

- Had no idea "climate tech" even existed and you have the opportunity to get paid to save planet earth

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
- Are brand new to the [basic terms](#basic-terms-and-definitions)
=======
- Need to brush up on [fundamental climate knowledge](#fundamental-climate-knowledge)

- Want to understand [what a climate job is like](#what-is-a-climate-job-like)
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

- Have never heard of the Project Drawdown [Solution Framework](#project-drawdown-solution-frameworks) or the [Speed and Scale OKR tracker](#speed-and-scale-okr-tracker)

- Are not yet a member and would like to learn more about these 3 [core communities](#core-communities):
	- The Handbook Slack Community
	- Work on Climate
	- MCJ Collective

:::info Lesson Start

If you already know the [definitions](#definition-of-level-1-and-level-2) of all 3 levels and are not struggling with [tech experience or specialized skill challenges](we-are-almost-ready-to-start-the-lesson-for-level-0-but-first)().

**Skip below to start the lesson** üëá.

Otherwise please read the Important Criteria.

## Important Criteria

#### Definition of LEVEL 1 and LEVEL 2

:::note LEVEL 1
### üëâ [Skip ahead to LEVEL 1](level-1)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY IF you are past   [LEVEL 0](#definition-of-level-0) üëÜ

---

#### LEVEL 1 means

**You:**

* You are committed to being a climate worker for at least the next 5 years. That's when we will hit 1.5C and we **absolutely must** start drawing down greenhouse pollution every year until we hit net zero by 2050
<!-- insert link to definition of 1.5C, net zero, and 2050-->

* Your job search isn't going great and you are feeling "imposter syndrome"

* You aren't sure which general sector or specific [climate solution](solutions) you want to focus on yet

:::note LEVEL 2
### üëâ [Skip ahead to LEVEL 2](level-2)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY IF you are past   [LEVEL 1](level-0#%EF%B8%8F-start-here) üëÜ

#### LEVEL 2 means
* a

* b

* c

#### We are almost ready to [start the lesson](#lesson-start) for LEVEL 0 but first:

:::caution Important note for those who are struggling with specialized experience.

The tech world is a bit like Hollywood.

It's extremely competitive with millions of people clamoring to get a piece of the üá∫üá∏ American Dream‚Ñ¢.

You may feel frustrated and ready to give up.

Every job description wants a minimum of 3-5 years of specialized experience that you don't have.

**This problem is especially rampant in climate tech**.

Climate tech is a world of high risk early startups with founders and hiring managers who are under pressure to draft the best possible "talent" into the climate arena.

### üò© We feel your pain and are here to help

#### If you want to shrink 3 years of requred experience down to 3 months building a real world portfolio.

The Climate Tech Handbook is completely [open source](contribute).

You can join us on Slack and prove to the world that you're ready.

### What is "Climate Tech"?


#### A broad definition:

Any form of technology that will help us implement our climate goals, particularly the 1.5C goal which requires:

- 50% emission reduction by 2030
- Net zero emissions by 2050.

#### The industry definition:

In the Silicon Valley style tech world, there is a movement toward investing in startups that are focused on a particular climate solution.

#### Climate tech vs Clean tech:

First - **fixing climate is a subset** within a broader circle of clean technologies. For example, water pollution, plastic pollution, or e-waste do not cause greenhouse emissions. However, they are still a critical problem affecting environmental health, justice, and the biodiversity crisis.

Second - **clean tech has an association** with a green startup period during the Obama administraton. Experiments from that time didn't quite turn out as expected. <!--link--> Climate tech is a version 2.0 [renaissance] for the 2020s.

## What is a climate job like?

:::question Frequently Asked Questions
- How well does it pay?
- How do I learn the necessary skills?
- How secure are these jobs?
- How do I avoid greenwashing?
:::


### How well does it pay?

#### Early stage startups:

- Climate tech companies focusing on a specific climate [solution](solutions) tend to be early stage startups.
- Early stage startups are more likely to pay lower salaries in exchange for generous equity packages.
- That said, climate startups want to attract quality talent and understand that competitive pay is important.


#### Established companies:

- You can try to change the direction of a bigger company
- Project Drawdown has a [guide on this topic](park)
- Companies like Microsoft, Google, Stripe, etc. have a specific corporate sustainbility positions. There are also many consultancies.
- Think outside the box. For example, you are in procurement, you have a huge opportunity to order supplies that come from clean sources. Start a green team that doesn't exist in your current job


#### Government Jobs

- There are plenty of government jobs <!--governmentjobs.com example urls-->
- The salaries are lower, but some states and counties <!--munis??--> offer good health care and pensions
- There can be a higher level of job security, predictability, and transparency compared to a fast moving startup environment.
