!!! Warning "Heavy work in progress"

# Hard Questions

## What is the role of [nature based solutions](../nature-based-solutions)?

The common belief is that tech won't save us fast enough.

We need nature based solutions to play a role.


## Should we tax carbon instead of using carbon markets?


## Notes

_Regarding LCOE, the critical thing to note is that drivers of reduction of LCOE often come from the hard tech/deep tech side, and many bets need to be placed on this hard tech before we can commercialize this._
