## Overview

* **Building Retrofitting Defined**: Refurbishing existing buildings to reduce their carbon footprint by leveraging methods like improved insulation, energy-efficient windows, and advanced heating/cooling mechanisms.
* **Technological Drivers**: Innovations such as aerogel insulation and energy-efficient windows propel the movement.
* **Key Players**: Johnson Controls, U.S. Green Building Council.

## Progress Made

* **Major Retrofitting Measures**: Incorporation of thermal insulation, efficient windows, and green roofs.
* **Pioneering Organizations**: Entities such as the International Energy Agency, U.S. Department of Energy, and Carbon Trust have significantly contributed.

## Lessons Learned

* **Strategic Planning**: A well-thought-out strategy targeting maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness is paramount.
* **Collaborative Efforts**: Success hinges on engaging every stakeholder, from proprietors to legislators.
* **Diverse Funding Avenues**: Broadening financial strategies can render retrofitting more accessible.
* **360-degree Approach**: Beyond physical improvements, retrofitting must address operational elements.
* **Synergy with Larger Objective**: Retrofitting efforts should synchronize with overarching decarbonization goals.

## Challenges Ahead

* **Financial Barriers**: Steep costs of retrofitting deter smaller enterprises and homeowners.
* **Knowledge Deficit**: A prevalent unawareness regarding retrofitting's advantages impedes its mass adoption.
* **Talent Shortfall**: The deficit of skilled personnel can compromise the quality of retrofit projects.

## Best Path Forward

* **Defined Objectives**: Clearly outline retrofitting aspirations in line with climate change abatement goals.
* **Broad Engagement**: Involve an array of stakeholders from inception to execution.
* **Thorough Assessment**: Undertake a comprehensive energy evaluation to pinpoint retrofit opportunities.
* **Tailored Interventions**: Choose retrofit measures apt for the structure and its climatic conditions, with an emphasis on energy conservation.
* **Staged Execution**: Adopt a phased approach, commencing with economically viable solutions.
* **Assessment & Outreach**: Persistently track performance and circulate findings to benefit broader communities.
* **Prominent Organizations**: International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Building Decarbonization Coalition.
